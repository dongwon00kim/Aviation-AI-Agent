## Preface

## FOR SIMULATION USE ONLY DESIGNED FOR SINGLE-PILOT OPERATIONS

This guide is designed to help provide a straightforward set of instructions to aid in operating the Airbus A32Oneo aircraft. It has been produced using multiple real-world Airbus A32Oneo operator manuals from various dates and sources with modifications to various procedures to make them more manageable under single-pilot operations.

## PHOTOSENTIVE SEIZURE WARNING

A very small percentage of people may experience a seizure when exposed to certain visual images; including flashing lights or patterns that may appear in video games. Even people who have no history of seizures or epilepsy may have an undiagnosed condition that can cause these "photosensitive epileptic seizures" while playing video games.

Immediately stop playing and consult a doctor if you experience any symptoms.

These seizures may have a variety of symptoms; including light-headedness; altered vision; eye or face twitching; jerking; or shaking of arms or legs; disorientation; confusion; or momentary loss of awareness. Seizures may also cause loss of consciousness or convulsions that can lead to injury from falling down or striking nearby objects.

Parents should watch for or ask their children about the above symptoms. Children and teenagers are more likely than adults to experience these seizures.

Youmay reduce risk of photosensitive epileptic seizures by taking the following precautions:

- Play in a well-lit room.
- Do not play if you are drowsy or fatigued.

If youor any of your relatives have ahistory of seizures or epilepsy; consult a doctor before playing video games.

## About the Airbus A32Oneo

The A32Oneo is a twin-engine;   narrow-body;   short-to-medium-range commercial   airliner developed and manufactured by European aviation consortium Airbus. The A32Oneo is a highefficiency; evolutionary iteration of the company's A32O,one of the most successful commercial airliners ever created: The "neo" designation is an acronym for engine option;" a reference to next-generation; optimized-efficiency; high-bypass turbofan engines that power the aircraft "new

The A32Oneo is the flagship model of the A32Oneo single-aisle line of jets that includes the A319neo and the A32Ineo variants. The original A320 first took to the sky on February 22, 1987 and was introduced just over a year later on April 18,1988. The A32Oneo took its maiden flight on September 25,2014 andit entered service on January 25,2016. Piloted by two; the A32Oneo can carry up to 195 passengers; although it typically accommodates up to 165 in standard seating arrangements.

The A32Oneo variant of the A320 traces its roots to a 2006 Airbus initiative to enhance the efficiency of the A320 family of aircraft;  This program focused on a series of aerodynamic improvements; including anti-vortex winglets.   Trademarked as "Sharklets" by Airbus; these increase  operational   efficiency by reducing drag-inducing wingtip vortices. This   efficiency optimizing outlook then included introducing updated powerplants These new engines burn less fuel per mile and are more operationally robust from a maintenance standpoint; Overall; the combination of improved aerodynamic features and next-generation engines deliver a fuel savings of 20% over the original A320.

The A32Oneo features digital fly-by-wire control surface actuation; side-stick cockpit flight input; inches tall; and has a wingspan of 117 feet; 5 inches. It is powered by two wing-mounted CFM International LEAP (Leading Edge Aviation Propulsion) 1A26 high-bypass turbofan engines that each generate up to 27,120 pounds of thrust  The airliner has a range of 4,000 miles; a service ceiling of 39,800 feet above sea level; and a takeoff run of 6,400 feet; It cruises at 518 miles per hour and has a top speedof 544mph.

## Important Notes About the Airbus A320

The aircraft is normally operated by two pilots; however; the following procedures have been written for single simulator pilot operation:

Airbus aircraft are operated using several core concepts and design philosophies; explained below.

## Airbus Golden Rules

- Fly; navigate and communicate: In this order with appropriate task sharing
- Understand the Flight Mode Annunciator (FMA) at all times.
- Use the appropriate level of automation at all times
- Take action if events do not evolve as expected.

## The FMA (Flight Mode Annunciator)

The FMA is one of the most important systems to understand on any Airbus family aircraft as it is the mechanism that the aircraft uses to communicate to the flight crew exactly what actions it is undertaking at any given moment and what actions it will undertake in the immediate future

Where is the FMA located?

The boxed red area shows the FMA

<!-- image -->

What do the colors mean?

Blue indicates armed and Greenindicates engaged In the image we can see CLB (Climb) mode is armed along with NAV (Lateral Navigation) mode

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Whena condition changes; the FMA will indicate the change with abox Sometimes the box will flash, or you will hear a triple click and a flashing box This is when a mode has reverted without the pilot making an input and the aircraft wants to draw your attention toit; Below is an example of the box shown when NAV has changed to HDG

<!-- image -->

Each column on the FMA shows what the Autopilot (AP) or Auto Thrust (A/THR) is undertaking:

<!-- image -->

## Orange Autothrust operation

This indicates the aircrafts thrust setting.

## Vertical mode

This indicates the verticalmode the Flight Director and Autopilot are following.

## Grey=Lateralmode

## Purple= = Approach capability

This indicates the lateral mode the Flight Director and Autopilot are following.

<!-- image -->

This indicates the Autopilots current maximum approach capability  CAT 3 DUAL for example; is the equivalent of a CATIII (zero visibility) approach

## Pink= Autopilot; flight directorand ATHR state

This indicates the status of the currently engaged Autopilot and Flight Directors; as well as Autothrust engagement condition

## Lights out concept

What is the lights-out concept?

<!-- image -->

When configuring the aircraft prior to flight operations; allwhite lights should beselected off. The normal in-flight configuration has no lights shown at all.

Other colors of lights used in the cockpit

## Blue= Temporary selection

Some examples include auto brakes; APU; and External power; These are not normally selected for the entire flight; so are "Temporarily" selected.

Amber = Caution

## Red Warning

Toalert the pilot to abnormal and emergency conditions; the relevant system light will be highlighted.

Note on the ground; before engine start; some lights will indicate the amber abnormal status. This is normal

## Fly by wire concept

The system is based on maintaining a specified G force (acceleration force) During normal; level flight; the FBW system will hold the force (1G - level; no bank turns; no acceleration) if the flight controls are released from manual actuation Airbus FBW will not hold pitch or bank angles;it will

## Aircraft Systems

The A32Oneo has many advanced systems; many of which are tightly integrated in function with each other; The following section introduces the core systems required to successfully operate the aircraft in Microsoft Flight Simulator;

## Flight Management and Guidance System (FMGS)

The Flight Management and Guidance System (FMGS) comprises the following units:

- Two Flight Management Guidance Computers (FMGC)
- Two Multipurpose Control and Display Units (MCDU) (third MCDU is optional in some aircraft but not modelled in this simulation)
- One Flight Control Unit (FCU)
- Two Flight Augmentation Computers (FAC)

The Flight Management and Guidance System (FMGS) provides predictions of flight time; mileage; speed, economy profiles; and altitude It reduces cockpit workload; improves efficiency; and eliminates many routine operations generally performed by the flight crew

## Managed vs Selected Guidance

The FMGS computes the aircraft position continuously; using stored aircraft performance data and navigation data; Therefore; it can steer the aircraft along a preplanned route and vertical and speed profiles. This type of guidance is known as "managed"

If the flight crew wants to temporarily modify any flight parameter (SPD; V/S; HDG; etc), they may do so by using the various Flight Control Unit (FCU) selectors. The FMGS then guides the aircraft to the target value of this parameter that they have selected: This type of guidance is known as "selected"

## Flight Management and Guidance Computer (FMGC)

Each FMGC is divided into two main parts:

The Flight Management (FM) part controls the following functions:

- Navigation and management of navigation radios
- Prediction and optimization of performance
- Management of flight planning
- Display management.

The Flight Guidance (FG) part performs the following functions:

- Autopilot (AP) command
- Flight Director (FD) command
- Autothrust (A/THR) command.

<!-- image -->

## Multipurpose Control and Display Unit (MCDU)

<!-- image -->

Two MCDUs are installed on the pedestal for flight crew loading and data display; The MCDU allows the flight crew to interface with the FMGC by selection of a flight plan for lateral and vertical flight paths and speed profiles. The flight crew may also modify selected navigation or performance data and specific functions of Flight Management (revised flight plan; secondary flight plan; etc)

Data that is entered into the MCDU that is illogical or beyond the aircraft's capabilities will either be disregarded or will generate an advisory message.

<!-- image -->

The MCDU includes a display that generates 14 lines of 24 characters each; including:

<!-- image -->

- title line that gives the name of the current page in block letters.
- Six label lines; each of which names the data displayed just below it (on the data field line)
- Six data field lines that display computed data or data inserted by the flight crew
- The scratchpad line that displays:
- Specific messages
- Information the flight crew has entered by means of the number and letter keys and which can then be moved to one of the data fields.

- Function and Page keys Call up functions and pages the flight crew uses for flight management functions and
- ↑↓
- (or SLEW) keys Move a page up or down to display portions that are off the screen
- NEXTPAGE
- Moves to the next page of a multi-page element. An arrowin the top right corner indicates that another page is available key
- AIRPORT key

<!-- image -->

Calls up the flight plan page that contains the next airport along the current flight plan: Successive pushes on the key show the alternate airport; the origin airport (before takeoff) and the next airport again:

- Number and letter keys allow the flight crew to insert data in the scratchpad so that they can usea line select key to enter it in the main display.
- •
- Two keys have special functions: CLR (clear) Erases material (messages or inserted data) from the scratchpad or from certain areas of displayed pages. OVFY (overfly) key Allows the aircraft to overfly a selected waypoint; key

Use and operation of the MCDU is covered in the quick start quide

## Flight Control Unit (FCU or Autopilot)

## Basic Modes

Selected vs. managed modes; how do we change mode and what do they do?

- Selected is when the knob is pulled out so towards you; this means you have taken control away from the auto flight system:
- Managed is done by pushing the knob so giving control back to the auto flight system

The APis controlled by the FCU (Flight Control Unit) pictured below.

<!-- image -->

- SPD/MACH push button:
- Pushing this button changes the SPD target to the corresponding MACH target and vice versa.
- SPD/MACH knob: When pulled; this knob controls speed in IAS or MACH depending on altitude or if SPD MACH button pressed (upper left) When pushed; speed is 'managed' from the FMS.
- HDG (Heading) knob:
- When pulled; this knob controls heading or track; You can swap between heading and trackmode by pressing the HDG TRK button (5)

<!-- image -->

Pushing the knob arms managed NAV or within a set margin to the NAV track will automatically switch to NAV.

## LOC (Localizer) push button:

Pushing this pushbutton arms; engages; or disengages the ILS LOCmode This mode is normally used for localizer only approaches using managed lateral guidance with selected vertical guidance.

## HDG V/S - TRK FPA push button:

The pilot uses this push button to select HDG (associated with V/S) or TRK (associated with FPA)

Pushing it displays the Flight Path Vector (FPV) on the Primary Flight Display (PFD) or deletes it.

On the PFD; it changes the FD crossbar display (with the aircraft attitude as its reference) to the aircraft Flight Path Director (with the flight vector as its reference) and vice versa. path

HDG/VS

<!-- image -->

TRK/FPA

<!-- image -->

The heading reference changes into track reference in the HDG/TRK window and vice versa.

<!-- image -->

The vertical speed reference target changes into flight path angle reference target in the VIS-FPA window and vice versa.

<!-- image -->

- AP Engagement push buttons:
- AP2will engage Autopilot 2, normally associated with the First Officer side
- APIwill engage Autopilot 1,normally associated with the Captain side
- Engaging both AP's will provide system redundancy requirements for low visibility (CAT 2orabove) approaches and autoland capabilities.
- stick
- ATHR (Autothrust) push button:
- the thrust levers

The flight crew uses this push button to arm; activate or disconnect the autothrust. Disengaging the ATHR is usually done with the instinctive ATHR disconnect buttons on

- Altitude knob:

When pulled sets OPEN CLIMB/OPEN DES or LVL change in other terms. If altitude is above you OPEN CLB if below you OPEN DES.

<!-- image -->

When pushed this sets CLB/DESor VNAV in other terms. This mode cannot always be engaged as the situation depends on the flight mode and phase of flight The aircraft also needs to be in amanaged lateral mode (NAV) to engage any VNAV mode The inner knob is a switch to select between 100 or 1O00 feet increments.

## EXPED (Expedite) push button:

Engaging this mode will increase the vertical speed by selecting Green Dot in a climb or MO.80/34Okts in a descent

This pushbutton is used to engage the expedite mode

Can toggle between displaying altitude in meters (metric) or feet (imperial) on the primary flight displays

<!-- image -->

## VSor FPA selector knob:

Pulling changes from vertical mode to VS/FPA mode and the aircraft will comply to what whatis set in the window. Please be aware that Airbus aircraft can be slow to follow large VS orders as the AP limits G forces imparted for passenger comfort

Pushing the knob will set VS to 0 and command the aircraft to level off. This is used when need to level off quickly. you

## Other Flight Crew Interfaces

## Thrust Levers

The thrust levers serve as the primary link between the Flight Management Guidance Computer (FMGC); the Full Authority Digital Engine Control System (FADEC); and the flight crew Their functions include:

- Activating the autothrust during takeoff when FLX or TOGA is selected.

<!-- image -->

- Regulating the maximum thrust level when the autothrust is engaged
- Deactivating the autothrust system when the flight crew moves the levers to the IDLE position
- Enabling manual control of thrust when the autothrust is not in use
- Initiating standard modes like takeoff or go-around when TOGA (or FLX for takeoff) is selected.
- Configuring the autothrust to its active mode when the levers are positioned between IDLE and the CL detent or MCT.

<!-- image -->

## ElectronicFlight Instruments (EFIS)

Two Primary Flight Displays (PFD) and Navigation Displays (ND) continuously supply the flight crew with guidance for flight; navigation details; and system advice throughout all phases of the flight;

<!-- image -->

There are EFIS control panels positioned at each end of the glareshield; these are responsible for managing both the Primary and Navigation Displays. These panels feature controls for selecting different modes on the PFD; including a selector to display the barometric altimeter setting. On the ND; pilots can choose from various distance ranges; and there are two switches available for displaying either the left or right VOR/ADF bearing pointers on the ND.

<!-- image -->

## Radio and Transponder Functions

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Radio Management Panel (RMP)

If using the in-sim ATC menu functions to change frequency; the radio will automatically change; however you can manually tune the required frequency

<!-- image -->

- Active Frequency Display Displays the current radio frequency on the selected radio For example; in the picture

above: VHFIis the selected radio; so the active frequency on VHFIis currently 122.800.

- Transfer Key
- This tunes the selected receiver to the new active frequency.
- Pressing this key moves the active frequency to the standby window and the standby frequency to the active window.

<!-- image -->

## Standby Frequency/Course Display

A display window shows a standby frequency that the pilot can activate by pressing the transfer or change by rotating the tuning knobs. key

## Radio Communication Selection Keys

When the pilot presses one of these keys:

- The ACTIVE window displays the frequency set on that radio.
- The STBY/CRS window displays the selected standby frequency or course
- The selected key displays a green monitor light

## Frequency Selector Knob

The outer knob controls whole numbers; the inner knob controls decimal fractions.

The pilot uses these knobs to select the STBY frequency or CRS.

## Radio navigation Selection Keys

The pilot presses one of these keys to select a navigation radio to control through this RMP. This is used for manual radio navigation tuning only. This turns on the key's green monitor light.

## RMP ON/OFF Control

Controls the RMP power supply

## Radio Transmission Keys and Reception Knobs

Pressing and releasing the knob (knob out) selects the associated audio reception channel and the integral white light activates. Rotating the knob adjusts the volume

When pressed; the associated channel is selected for transmission; The three green lines display The pilot can deselect the channel by pressing the pushbutton again; or by selecting another channel;

## Intercom Radio Switch

Pressing and releasing each knob (knob out) selects the associated audio reception

<!-- image -->

## Transponder Panel

If using the in-sim ATC menu functions to change the squawk code; the transponder will automatically adjust to this change; however you can manually tune the required code

TA: The TCAS does not generate any vertical orders This mode should be used; in case of degraded aircraft performance (engine failure; landing gear extended; or approach on parallel runways).

- STBY: The TCAS is on standby.

<!-- image -->

## Weather Radar (WXR)

The Airbus A32Oneo features aweather radar which is shown on the Navigation Display (ND) screen.

<!-- image -->

- CAPT Weather Display Selector This must be in a setting other than 'Off' to display weather on the Navigation Display (ND).
- Weather Radar and Predictive Windshear Switch When selected 1or 2weather will be displayed on the ND.
- FO Weather Display Selector This must be in a setting other than 'Off' to display weather on the Navigation Display (ND).

## Operations and Techniques

This section outlines the procedures and techniques required to operate the A32Oneo safely and efficiently throughout all phases of flight

The sections are divided as follows:

Walk-through Guide: A complete A to B flight from cold and dark to shutdown to get you up and running;

Normal Checklist: To be used to Confirmprocedures have been completed correctly in prior flows. These are available as a separate document

Simplified Procedures: Condensed description of flows for quick reference Normally; actions are committed to memory; with this guide as a quick reference tool:

<!-- image -->

## Walk-through Guide

We are going to simulate a scheduled passenger service from Manchester; UK (EGCC) to Palma De Mallorca; Spain (LEPA). We will use the built-in Simbrief functionality and assume the user is familiar with creating and exporting a Simbrief flight plan

The procedures used here are not meant to replicate full real-world operations; this will; the pilot airborne and flying in the minimum amount of time get

We are assuming we have selected the aircraft and loaded itat an available stand at EGCC cold and dark

## Preliminary Cockpit Preparation

You can use the in-sim checklist to prepare the aircraft or simulate arriving at the aircraft prepared by an engineer with the ground power unit (GPU) or auxiliary power unit (APU) on; To do this; select Panel State (1) on the EFB and select 'On APU' or 'On GPU' as required: The simplified procedures checklist can also be used as a basic guide to supplement this walk through.

Note if the EFB screen appears blank; press the on button or increase the brightness

<!-- image -->

The aircraft will automatically run through its power-up test as indicated by the screen displays.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Whilst the aircraft is running through its power-up test; you can start preparing flight details and

In normal real-world operations; the aircraft Flight Management and Guidance Systems (FMGS) are initialized at this stage via the Multipurpose Control and Display Unit (MCDU) so that pre-flight planning data canbe sent and received by the airline operations control room;

<!-- image -->

The MCDU will normally be on the Aircraft Status page after the power up test Here you will check if the aircraft and engine type (1) are correct; You can also change the navigation database (2) if required by selecting L2 or L3.

<!-- image -->

If the MCDU has not initialized on this page or you have accidentally selected another page press DATA;then select key L4 for AC STATUS.

<!-- image -->

To enable synchronization with Simbrief; the MCDU will also need to be connected to this service You can do this by pressing the MCDU MENU (1) page; then selecting key L2 for ATSU (2).

<!-- image -->

Type your Simbrief username into the scratchpad and enter it into the username field by pressing select key RI

<!-- image -->

To initialize the flight; press the INIT page (1) key to bring up the INIT A page on the MCDU. If the Simbrief username is entered correctly; you should see an INIT REQUEST* message next to line the city (departure and destination airport ICAO) to load the active flight plan; For example; type EGCC/LEPA into the scratchpad and press line select key RI Confirmation of the saved route (if available) will be displayed pair

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

You will need to manually enter the Flight Number (1) and Cost Index (2) using the scratchpad to type the data and then the line select key to enter it.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Ensure your Simbrief username (2)is entered in the EFB Options tab (1). Note here that when entering text information; controls to the simulator are temporarily disabled. To exit this condition; press the remove keyboard function on the EFB (3)

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Ensure that you are on the EFB Dashboard page (1) and press the download Simbrief icon (2)

<!-- image -->

You willnotice when the import has been successful as the Flight Number; Departure; Destination and Alternate Airfield data will be populated: The OFP page of the EFB will also be populated

<!-- image -->

You can simulate opening the required doors for loading from the EFB Ground (1) page and pressing the Loading Config button (3) As You should now be running the aircraft on APU; you can disconnect the GPU by pressing the Toggle GPU button (2)

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

To load passengers and cargo you will select the Ground page (1) from the EFB shortcuts You can manually select the Zero Fuel Weight (ZFW) and Fuel load manually using the sliders. If the EFB option to use ZFW is set to 'No' then the pilot can select number of passengers and cargo weight manually instead. Once the desired values have been entered; pressing the Apply Load (3) button will start to add the payload.

<!-- image -->

You are given the option to set the loading speed of the aircraft at this point using 3 options.

<!-- image -->

The aircraft should now have power applied and running on its own with a load in progress or complete.

<!-- image -->

## Cockpit Preparation

The pilot's next responsibility is configuring the aircraft Flight Management and Guidance Systems (FMGS). This can be broken down into navigation; weight; and performance envelopes. To set up the aircraft correctly; you will use a number of cockpit 'flows' and scans. You can also use the in-sim checklist for guidance.

The scans normally start on the overhead panelusing a of bottom-to-top; left-to-right; Pay particular attention to the following items to ensure the aircraft is set up correctly for departure flow

- The GND CTL push button should be selected 'On'
- ADIRS selectors 1,2and 3need to be in NAV.
- Exterior lighting panel should be set as follows:
- STROBE switch - AUTO
- b BEACON switch - OFF
- C WING switch - OFF
- NAV&amp; LOGO switch - 1(either 1or 2can be used)
- e RWY TURN OFF switch - OFF
- LAND switches Both RETRACT
- NOSE switch OFF
- SEATBELTS switch - ONAUTO (once refueling has been completed)
- Passenger signs panel should be set as follows:
- b NO SMOKING switch - AUTO
- C EMER EXIT LT switch - ARM
- Fuel pump push button switches all On. white light (Off) switch should be turned On during this flow Any

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

The next flow is around the Center Instrument Panel; checking the ISIS (1) is on and aligned;

4320-

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

The Center Pedestal is the next flow focus. Here we will check that the WXR (1) is configured for departure (but not yet turned On); and the ATC transponder (2) is set with your squawk code if

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Now you can also finish setting up the FMGS using the MCDU interface Most of the information required will already be entered if using the Simbrief import function:

To enter the departure runway and Standard Instrument Departure (SID) press the F-PLN page (1) and press line select key LI (2) to open the lateral revision (LAT REV) subpage

<!-- image -->

Press line select key L1 again to enter the DEPARTURE runway and SID.

<!-- image -->

Using the left line select keys (1) to select and enter the required runway and the up and down slew keys (2) as required for additional runway options where applicable Repeat the process to enter the desired SID.

<!-- image -->

You can see above we have entered runway 23R and the SANBAIR departure at EGCC (Manchester). You can enter this directly to the flight plan by pressing the line select key RG or review the input fully by pressing the F-PLN page to return to the flight plan. key7

<!-- image -->

You can get a better view of the planned route on the ND by turning the EFIS control knob to PLAN and increasing the range You should also select the CSTR (constraints) option to confirm the flight plan altitudes are entered correctly according to the appropriate chart

Note the FMGS has no weight information at this so will draw straight lines between waypoints; point

<!-- image -->

At this point you can also receive wind data from Símbrief and enter a secondary flight plan; usually used for an immediate return to the departure airfield; if required. Depending on the length of flight; the arrival can also be entered at this point; but for this demonstration you will leave as-is until you are in the cruise phase

<!-- image -->

Most of the lateral and vertical navigation should now be set in the FMGS. The aircraft now needs to know the weight to calculate lateral and vertical performance To do this; you will need to enter values in the INIT B page.

Select the INIT page and slew right using the slew keys.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

The Zero Fuel Weight (1) and ZFWCG (2) to enter can be taken from the EFB Payload page.

<!-- image -->

The block fuel can also be taken from this page but is usually taken from the upper ECAMFuel On Board (FOB) display.

<!-- image -->

You then need to calculate some safe takeoff performance criteria for the aircraft based on current airfield conditions and the aircraft payload This can be done using the EFB Takeoff page (1).

Pressing the Sync (2) button will sync the airfield live weather data from the sim and the aircraft weight. You need to adjust the takeoff runway and aircraft configuration in certain circumstances. may

Once all the data is entered; you can press Calculate (3) to view the performance figures. If satisfied with the output these can be sent directly to the FMGS by pressing the Send to FMGS button (4)

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Note on the MCDU PERF page that the takeoff speeds are now 'armed' (1). To confirm the takeoff data (2) press line select key RG. This should also populate the Flex to Temp (3)

<!-- image -->

You would normally cross check the data entered from the EFB.

<!-- image -->

The only item that is not entered; but required for aircraft configuration is the Flap and Trimmable Horizontal Stabilizer (THS) setting (1).

<!-- image -->

This should be entered in the MCDU scratchpad using the format VO.4UP and entered into the performance page using line select R3. key

This concludes the minimum MCDU configuration requirements. The final element of the FMGS and cockpit pre-flight preparation is to set up the autopilot (FCU)

<!-- image -->

Check that the altimeter pressure setting (1) is correctly set on the FCU (you can press the default command 'B'to set the correct pressure) key

The Flight Directors (FD) (2) are required to be 'On' for both Captain and FO sides. They should be turned 'On' by default during the initialization process.

The Speed (SPD) and Lateral Navigation (LAT) should both be automatically in Managed Mode (3) If they arenot; pushing the relevant control selector knob underneath the display will activate

The FCU should be in Heading and Vertical Speed (HDG V/S) mode (4)

You can set your first assigned altitude using the altitude selector knob (5). This is normally indicated on the SID chart or given by ATC. For your purposes; you will set this to your final cruise altitude The aircraft will respect altitude constraints in the FMGS flight plan if entered correctly.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Armed and Active modes are cross checked on the Primary Flight Display (PFD)

The Decision (VI) and Initial Climb Speed (V2) are displayed on the speed tape (1).

The vertical and lateral flight direct and autopilot modes are armed (blue) on the Flight Mode Annunciator (FMA) (2).

Both Flight Directors are 'On' (3).

The FCU altitude is set to our initial altitude (4)

The aircrafts current altitude (5) is correct according to relevant data on the currently selected pressure setting (6).

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Before Engine Start

Before commencing the next phase; the first item you should check is to ensure the loading is fully complete and that the aircraft is ready for pushback and engine start Press the EFB Ground Page and select Close All: You should also remove the GPU and Chocks if

not already completed.

Youcan confirm the status of the doors from the cockpit by viewing the lower ECAMdisplay This should normally be on the DOOR/OXY page after initialization but can be selected by pressing the ECAM control DOOR button

4320-

<!-- image -->

Once all exits and cargo compartments are closed; we can call ATC for pushback and start up clearance

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

The thrust levers are fully idle (1).

And the parking brake is set to ON (2)

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Pushback and Engine Start

The pushback can be initiated using the in-sim ATCmenu or the EFB control:

and Aft buttons (2) to guide the pushback direction;

Release the parking brake to commence the procedure

Once you reach the desired point on the taxiway; the pushback can be stopped by pressing the STOP button; The pushback will automatically disconnect. tug

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

You can start the engines while the pushback is underway. Ensure the APUis Available (AVAIL)

<!-- image -->

The Airbus A32Oneo will normally start engine 2 first; this is so hydraulic power from the engine can then be used to control the brakes during pushback

Turn the Engine Mode Selector to IGNISTART and then turn Engine Master Switch to ON (2).

<!-- image -->

Once the startup is successfully completed by the FADEC;an AVAIL indication is shown

temporarily on the ECAM Engine Warning Display (EWD) Starting engine 1is done by performing the identical procedure

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## After Engine Start

After the start sequence has completed on both engines and the pushback tug has disconnected; you will conduct another procedure flow.

- Turn the Engine Mode selector to NORM.
- Turn the APU Bleed OFF and then the APU Master switch OFF
- Reset the rudder trim to zero (2).
- Set the Flaps (3) to the required takeoff setting; in this scenario Flaps 1.
- Set the trim wheel (4) to the setting in the MCDU Takeoff PERF page and EFB calculation by dragging it up or down

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

The aircraft is now ready to taxi under its own power;

<!-- image -->

## Taxi Out

Normally the next set of flows is done during the taxi but for simplicity you will conduct these before attempting to move As you become more competent with handling the aircraft you will be able to do these while the aircraft is moving

First set the Nose Light to TAXI; this will indicate to aircraft and vehicles around you that the aircraft is about to move under its own power;

<!-- image -->

Turn the WXR/PWS On by selecting System 1and ensure that the CAPT and the FO Display knob

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Next, set the Auto Brake to MAX (1).

Check the T,O. Memo has no blue; Cabin Ready (2) may still be waiting in some instances. You can force this to the 'Ready' requirement by pressing the FWD CALL on the overhead panel

Once all the criteria are fulfilled; you can press the TO CONFIG test (3) push button on the ECAM control panel to complete the test

7acc

<!-- image -->

Youcan nowbegin the taxi to the runway for departure This is normally done using the tiller located on the side console For simulation purposes this is linked to the rudder pedals for easier use.

<!-- image -->

Releasing the parking brake and leaving the engines at idle is usually sufficient to get the aircraft rolling; at heavier weights; a slight increase in thrust be required: This should be limited to a maximum of 40% NI may

<!-- image -->

Taxi to the active runway using the minimum thrust required whilst keeping your speed below 20 kts. This can be monitored with the Ground Speed (GS) indication on the top left of the Navigation Display (ND). The preferred method is to allow speed to build to 20 kts then apply one smooth brake application to slow the aircraft to around 5 to 10 kts. This avoids applying constant brake pressure which will cause them to overheat prior to departure

Apply the parking brake; holding short of the departure runway.

<!-- image -->

## Before Takeoff

Once takeoff clearance is received; there is once again a flow to follow to ensure the aircraft is fully prepared for departure For ease; complete this while the aircraft is stationary.

- Exterior lighting panel should be set as follows:
- STROBE switch - ON
- b WING switch - ON
- C RWY TURN OFF switch - ON
- LAND switches Both ON
- e NOSE switch - TO
- ATC Transponder and Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS)
- ATC Mode AUTO/ON
- b TARA Selector TARA

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Depending on aircraft performance and external conditions; would now normally confirm the status of the Air Conditioning PACKS and Engine Ignition mode For this flight it is not required you

<!-- image -->

## Takeoff

We suggest you read through these next steps a few times before attempting the takeoff; as with any aircraft the takeoff and initial climb phase progress in quick succession; andit is easy to 'get behind' the aircraft. Line up with the runway and apply the parking brake initially (you would not do this for normal operations)

The A32Oneo thrust management is conducted by the FADEC and FMGS. There are two main settings for takeoff: Takeoff and Go Around (TOGA)or FLEX TOGA will provide maximum available thrust to the engines whereas FLEX effectively derates the engines to provide less power but increase engine life

Note To make use of the FLEX setting you must enter a FLEX temperature value in the MCDU Performance page

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

The throttles have detents and audible clicks for each phase So, for FLEX takeoff you will move forward two detents/clicks; for TOGA you would move the throttles fully forward (or 3 detents/clicks)

<!-- image -->

Hold the side stick approximately half travel forward; this ensures the nosewheel remains in contact with the ground and nose wheel steering can be maintained during acceleration; Now release the parking brake The aircraft will accelerate quicklyl Maintain the runway center line using the rudder pedals to steer; The fly-by-wire system will gradually blend nosewheel steering to the rudder only.

You will notice some annunciators appear on the PFD indicating that elements of the FMGS and AP are active or arming. Notably the thrust mode is in FLEX; the vertical guidance is in Speed Reference System (SRS) Mode and the lateral navigation is in Runway (RWY) track mode Finally the auto thrust (ATHR) has armed. Climb and Navigation modes are currently still armed; ready for the acceleration phase

Whilst accelerating; gradually release the forward stick pressure to a neutral point by 100 kts. Shortly after you will reach VI (first speed indicated in blue (1)) your decision speed. Barring any major technical issues; you will continue the takeoff. At VR (the blue circle on the speed tape (1)) we will gradually initiate the rotation by pulling back on the stick gently We are aiming for an initial climb attitude of 15 degrees within about 5 to 6 seconds. The Flight Directors will guide you to the correct attitude You can now engage Autopilot 1 (API)

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Once airborne with the aircraft positively climbing; raise the landing gear by selecting the Landing Gear Lever to the UP position Confirmation the gear is moving will be indicated by the LDG GEAR position lights turning to the red UNLK position on the SD page and the position indicator just above the lever.

<!-- image -->

The next phase of the takeoff will accelerate the aircraft to its clean configuration and climb speed; normally 250 kts below 1O,OOO ft. The acceleration segment will normally happen

<!-- image -->

between 1O00 and 1,500 ft above ground level. This canbe set to automatically populate in the MCDU PERF page via the EFB. The Autopilot will automatically pitch down to achieve this acceleration; You will also note another change in the FMA ordering the thrust levers to be set to Climb power (LVR CLB) and flashing white Vertical CLB and lateral NAVmodes are now fully engaged (indicated in Green)

<!-- image -->

Now the aircraft is accelerating you will notice an Sor F (depending on takeoff set) approaching from the top of the speed tape on the PFD. This will shortly be followed by a red and black 'barbers pole' indicating a maximum flight envelope speed; in this case our maximum Flap speed in this configuration The active speed mode is now Thrust Climb (THR CLB) flap

When reaching the S speed raise the flaps by setting the Flap Lever to 0.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

You can now complete the initial part of yourclimb check flow.

- Disarm the speed brakes by pushing the lever in. Be carefulnot to deploy speed brakes; the aircraft will provide a warning if you do this.
- Set the lights to the following:
- NOSE - OFF
- b RWYTURN OFF\_ OFF

Now the aircraft is safely climbing to its cruise flight level.

## Climb

You may sometimes be on a Standard Instrument Departure (SID) that has specific climb restrictions such as the SANBA departure from Manchester. The autopilot will temporarily stop the aircraft from climbing due to this restriction This will be evident from a magenta altitude constraint on the PFD altitude tape and the FMA indicating Altitude Constraint (ALT CST) mode

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

You can however override this and continue a constant climb to your selected cruise altitude To do this you would pull to 'take' control from the autopilot

<!-- image -->

The aircraft will enter an Open Climb (OP CLB) as indicated by the FMA on the PFD. Once past the constraint you can 'give' back control to the autopilot by pushing the same selector.

The aircraft should now continue to top of climb without any further interaction; You do; however; need to clean up the external lights and ensure the correct pressure setting is set

<!-- image -->

Set Standard (STD) pressure (1013 hPa or 29.92inHg) by pressing the baro selector knob.

<!-- image -->

Landing lights should be retracted above 10,OOO ft and the passenger seat belt sign can also be set to Auto

<!-- image -->

## Cruise

Few pilot actions need to be performed during the cruise phase of the flight other than monitoring the aircraft systems and tactically managing the guidance system For demonstration educational purposes; explore some of the functions:

You can use the MCDU to give the FMGS a waypoint to fly-to directly. These are effectively short cuts given by ATC to save time and fuel The procedure is simple after some practice

- Select the Direct To (DIR) page on the MCDU (1).
- Use the slew keys (2) up and down to find the desired waypoint. In our example this is BALAN
- Press the line select key (3) next to BALAN to enter it in to the DIR TO.
- Activate the DIR TO by pressing line select key LI (4)

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

The aircraft will turn towards BALAN automatically. You can confirm thatthe aircraft is navigating to the correct point by checking the TO waypoint on the ND.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Approach Preparation

will provide the flight directors and autopilot with the information required to successfully guide the aircraft to the runway.

For this arrivalyou will follow a Standard Arrival Route (STAR) followed by a conventional Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach. You willexecute a fully automatic landing using the autopilot This is usually reserved for low visibility operations; and you can; of course; manually fly the landing if you desire

To start preparing the FMGS press F-PLN page to ensure you are on the active route; and press line select key L6 next to LEPA

Press line select key RI to select the arrivals page

And then press line select key L5 to select the ILSY for Runway 24L

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Scroll down the slew keys until you find the LOREIP arrival; press the relevant line select at line select key RG. using

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

You can check that the navigation data; in particular the ILS course and frequency; has been entered correctly by pressing the MCDU RADNAV page button;

Note the ILS/FREQ and (ILS) CRS is only auto populated in the MCDU when the aircraft has less than 3OONMto go.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

To give us an idea of track mileage and direction to the airport we can enter a waypoint to give a constant bearing and distance This is done by pressing the MCDU PROG (1) page button; entering the desired waypoint in the scratchpad; and then pressing line select key R4 (2)

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Next to help the FMGS vertical guidance path and estimations; you will insert the arrival airfield information in the MCDU PERF page (1). Cycle through the available Next Phase pages using line select key RG until you reach the APPR (3) page.

Enter the information required at line select LI to 3 by entering it into the MCDU scratchpad and then pressing the requisite line select key. This information can be found on the EFB Flight Details page Pressing the Update Button will provide the most recent live weather;

<!-- image -->

The final element to complete on the PERF page is the decision altitude As you are planning to do an Autoland; you will type NOin the RADIO.

<!-- image -->

With all the PERF data entered; your page should look similar to the following:

<!-- image -->

You should also consider the length of runway available and how you are going to stop the aircraft after touching down; The aircraft uses a combination of retardation devices including spoilers; thrust reversers; and wheel brakes to decelerate Palma is a large international airport with runways soyou can safely use a low autobrake setting. Press the Auto Break Lo button. long

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

You should be approaching your of descent at this point indicated by the small white arrow along the flight plan lateral path. top

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Descent

You can initiate a descent once the aircraft is within a few nautical miles of the descent arrow The FMGS requires two parameters to commence the descent:

Normally; ATC dictates descents as series of 'step downs' ; but for the purpose of this guide; you

1OOO feet

<!-- image -->

Tobegin the aircrafts descent; push the knob to enter managed descent mode

The FMA should now read like the following:

<!-- image -->

This route has some altitude constraints similar to your departure A constraint with a + indicates that you must remain above the level; a constraint with a -indicates that you must remain below the level; and a constraint with just a level indicates you should remain at the level.

<!-- image -->

When descending through 10,000 ft you can set the landing light switches to ON and the seat belt signs to ON. The autopilot should automatically reduce speed to 250 kts. You will also select the Landing System (LS) pushbuttons to ON to give you and the autopilot guidance.

<!-- image -->

If you find the aircraft is remaining too high above the desired descent trajectory; indicated by a small green dot gradually moving below the current altitude; you can apply speed brakes Set them to half initially to see if this reduces the error;

## Approach

Youwould normally be cleared for the approach by ATC; but you can set the FCU by pressing the second AP button to ON and arming the approach by pressing the APPR button

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Youshould also activate the approach phaseby pressing line select key Le. The FMGS will automatically initiate this phase when flying over the approach deceleration point indicated by a magenta D on the flight plan.

<!-- image -->

The FMA will display multiple pieces of information The primary elements on which to focus during the approach are the lateral and vertical modes having armed and captured the ILS. This is indicated by the G/S* and LOC*.

You will also note that the aircraft has indicated that it has a Category (CAT) 3 Dual approach capability; meaning that it can fully Autoland.

The ILS identifier; frequency; and distance to g0 (DME) is indicated at the bottom left of the PFD. The localizer and glide slope deviation bars indicate our vertical and lateral track compared to the ILS signal from the ground.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Before intercepting the final approach; you need to begin slowing the aircraft to its final approach speed. There are two speeds to consider as you slow through the approach phases. The VFE Next indicated by orange stripes and the Next scheduledF or S speed. The aircraft's speed must be below VFE next to avoid an overspeed and close to the Sor Fspeed to select the next stage of settings. flap-

<!-- image -->

After Flaps 2you will select the gear down; this will also help the aircraft decelerate whilst descending along the glide path

<!-- image -->

Once below 200O ft and in landing configuration; the landing memo will be displayed to confirm that the aircraft is ready for landing;

Ensure that the spoilers are armed by pulling the spoiler control;

<!-- image -->

The aircraft will now complete an automatic landing and rollout; bringing the aircraft to a complete stop You willbe prompted at approximately 20 ft to 'Retard' the throttles; move the throttle controls to the idle position or press FI on your keyboard: Once the main wheels have contacted the runway you can deploy reverse thrust by pressing F2,or if calibrated via the EFB; the reverse thrust range on your throttles Cancel reverse thrustat approximately 60-70 kts by process and bring toacomplete stop on the runway. you

<!-- image -->

If you want to intervene before reaching a complete stop; disconnect the autopilot by pressing the button on the side stick (1) You will also need to press the brakes to manually take control of braking again;

<!-- image -->

Congratulations; you have completed the flightl You can now taxi to an available parking stand and follow the in-sim checklist to shut down and secure the aircraft or the simplified procedures
