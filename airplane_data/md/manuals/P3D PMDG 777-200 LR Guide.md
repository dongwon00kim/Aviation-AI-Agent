777-200LR

## PART 1 -INTRODUCTION

The Boeing 777 is a long-range wide-body twin-engine jet airliner developed and  manufactured  by Boeing Commercial  Airplanes. It is the world's largest twinjet and has a typical seating capacity of 314 to 396 passengers, with  a range of  5,240  to  8,555 nautical  miles (9,704  to  15,844 km). Commonly  referred  to  as  the  "Triple  Seven", its  distinguishing  features include  the  largest-diameter turbofan engines  of  any  aircraft,  long  raked wings,  six  wheels  on  each  main landing  gear,  fully  circular  fuselage  crosssection, and a blade-shaped tail cone. Developed in consultation with eight major airlines, the 777 was designed to replace older wide-body airliners and bridge  the  capacity  difference  between  Boeing's 767 and 747.  Boeing's first fly-by-wire airliner,  it  has  computer-mediated  controls.  It  was  also  the first commercial aircraft to be designed entirely with computer-aided design.

The 777 is produced in two fuselage lengths as of 2018. The original 777-200 variant entered commercial service in 1995, followed by the extended-range 777-200ER in 1997. The stretched 777-300, which is 33.25 ft (10.1 m) longer, followed  in  1998.  The  initial  777-200,  extended-range  -200ER,  and  -300 versions are equipped with General Electric GE90, Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000, or Rolls-Royce Trent 800 engines. They have since been collectively referred to as 777 Classics. The extended-range 777-300ER and ultra long-range 777200LR variants entered service in 2004 and 2006 respectively, while the 777F, a freighter version,  debuted  in  February  2009;  these  second-generation variants all feature high-output GE90 engines and extended raked wingtips. The 777-200LR is one of the world's longest-range airliners, able to fly more than  halfway  around  the  globe  and  holds  the  record  for  the  longest distance flown non-stop by a commercial aircraft.

The  777  ranks  as  one  of  Boeing's  best-selling  models,  making  it  the  mostproduced  Boeing  wide-body  jet,  surpassing  the  Boeing  747. Airlines  have acquired the type as a comparatively fuel-efficient alternative to other widebody jets and have increasingly deployed the aircraft on long-haul transoceanic routes. Direct market competitors include the Airbus A330-300, the Airbus  A350  XWB,  and  the  out-of-production A340 and McDonnell Douglas MD-11. The 787 Dreamliner, which entered service in 2011, shares design features and a common type rating for pilots with the 777.

The 777 is one of the most modern aircraft available in Prepar3d and FSX. It comes with built-in checklists that are accessible directly on the multifunction displays, which makes the pilots' life much easier.

## PART 1 -INTRODUCTION

In  the  early  1970s,  the Boeing  747, McDonnell  Douglas  DC-10,  and  the Lockheed  L-1011  TriStar became  the  first  generation  of wide-body  passenger  airliners to  enter  service. In 1978, Boeing unveiled three new models: the twin-engine Boeing 757 to replace its 727, the twin-engine 767 to challenge the Airbus A300, and a trijet 777 concept to compete with the DC-10 and L-1011. The mid-size 757 and 767 launched to market success, due in part to 1980s' extended-range twin-engine operational performance standards (ETOPS) regulations governing  transoceanic  twinjet  operations. These  regulations  allowed  twin-engine  airliners  to  make  ocean  crossings  at  up  to  three  hours'  distance  from  emergency diversionary airports. Under ETOPS rules, airlines began operating the 767 on long-distance overseas routes that did not require the capacity of larger airliners. The trijet 777 was later dropped, following marketing studies that favored the 757 and 767 variants. Boeing was left with a size and range gap in its product line between the 767-300ER and the 747-400.

By the late 1980s, DC-10 and L-1011 models were approaching retirement age, prompting manufacturers to develop replacement designs. McDonnell Douglas was working on the MD-11, a stretched and upgraded successor of the DC-10,[while Airbus was developing its A330 and A340. In 1986, Boeing unveiled proposals for an enlarged 767, tentatively named 767-X,to target the replacement market for first-generation wide-bodies such as the DC-10, and to complement existing 767 and 747 models in the company lineup. The initial proposal featured a longer fuselage and larger wings than the existing 767, along with winglets. Later plans expanded the fuselage cross-section but retained the existing 767 flight deck, nose, and other elements.

Airline customers were uninterested in the 767-X proposals, and instead wanted an even wider fuselage cross-section, fully flexible interior configurations, short- to intercontinental-range capability, and an operating cost lower than any 767 stretch. Airline planners' requirements for larger aircraft had become increasingly specific, adding to the heightened competition among aircraft manufacturers. By 1988, Boeing realized that the only answer was a new clean -sheet design, which became the 777 twinjet. The company opted for the twin-engine configuration given past design successes, projected engine developments, and reduced-cost benefits. On December 8, 1989, Boeing began issuing offers to airlines for the 777.

## PART 1 -INTRODUCTION

Some people think that the 777 is just a bigger 737 with a longer range. This couldn't be further from the truth. The 777 simulated by PMDG represents an aircraft that has a high degree of automation. The systems of the 777 significantly reduce the pilot's workload and people used to fly older aircraft will find themselves often wondering if they missed something or not.  If you plan to fly the 777 on real routes, a 12-hour flight on a highly automated aircraft may feel a little boring. That's how I discovered that the aircraft will trigger an advisory requiring a pilot response if you let the aircraft fly on autopilot for too long. Pretty neat, eh? The 777 may feel like a simple aircraft to operate at first, but there is evidently a lot of work going on 'under the hood' .

The Triple-Seven is huge. I never realized how big it was until I stood right next to one and saw that a whole fuselage could fit through its GE90 engines of epic proportions. This aircraft is also seriously long, so that tight cornering during taxi becomes a challenge. Taking off and landing the aircraft requires careful input since it is easy to smack the aircraft's tail  on  the ground. This is an aircraft begging to be discovered and studied, and it is obvious that PMDG did put a lot of care and thought into making sure we are flying the highest-fidelity version of the aircraft to date.

## EFIS (Electronic Flight Instrument System) Control Panel

Note 1 : The EFIS is a flight deck instrument display system that displays flight data electronically rather than electromechanically. An EFIS normally consists of a primary flight display ( PFD ), multi-function display ( MFD ), and an engine indicating and crew alerting system ( EICAS ) display.

Note 2 : The complex electromechanical attitude director indicator (ADI) and horizontal situation indicator (HSI) were the first candidates for replacement by EFIS.

## PART 3 -FLIGHT PLAN &amp; PRE-START

## PLANNING THE FLIGHT

In real life, you cannot just fly a 777 wherever and whenever you please. Just like on land, the sky is littered with an intricate network of waypoints and aerial highways. Therefore, it is necessary to plan your flight route and to determine how much fuel you will need to carry in order to reach your destination.

In order to do this, we will use a tool called 'Online Flight Planner' available here: http://onlineflightplanner.org/

There are a number of fuel planners available online. These estimates may or may not be very accurate. There are specific charts created by Boeing to come up with accurate fuel estimates which are unfortunately not available to the public.  Therefore,  for  the  sake  of  simplicity  we  will  just  use  a  rule  of  thumb that's good enough for the purpose of this tutorial.

PART 3

## PLANNING THE FLIGHT

Today's flight will start from AMSTERDAM-SCHIPHOL (EHAM) and our destination will be LONDON-HEATHROW (EGLL).

Using the 'Online Flight Planner' available here: http://onlineflightplanner.org/  we will enter the Departure airport (EHAM), the Destination airport (EGLL) and the AIRAC Cycle desired (we will use the AIRAC cycle 1702 as explained on the next page).

Click on CREATE PLAN to generate a flight plan.

## PLANNING THE FLIGHT

In aviation,  an Aeronautical Information Publication (or AIP ) is defined by  the International Civil Aviation Organization as a publication issued by or with the authority of a state and containing aeronautical information of a lasting character essential to air navigation. It is designed to be a manual containing thorough details of regulations, procedures and other information pertinent to flying aircraft in the particular country to which it relates. It is usually issued by or on behalf of the respective civil aviation administration. AIPs are kept up-to-date by regular revision on a fixed cycle. For operationally significant changes in information, the cycle known as the AIRAC (Aeronautical Information Regulation And Control) cycle is used: revisions are produced every 56 days (double AIRAC cycle) or every 28 days (single AIRAC cycle). These changes are received well in advance so that users of the aeronautical data can update their flight management systems (FMS). (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeronautical\_Information\_Publication )

In  other  words,  some  Youtube tutorials might show you flight routes with certain waypoints that got changed with more recent AIRAC updates. Some waypoints or even airports may not exist anymore. Therefore, you have two options:

1. Plan your flight using the default AIRAC cycle programmed in the FMC when it was first coded by PMDG during early February, 2017 (period 02) 20 17 (AIRAC cycle 1702 ), which is what we will do for this tutorial. This option is free and simple if you fly alone. However, if you fly with online ATCs in multiplayer that use the latest AIRAC database, you should go for the second option.
2. Plan  your  flight  using  the  latest  AIRAC  cycle.  You  will  need  to  update  your  AIRAC,  SID  and  STAR  database  by  using  a  paid  subscription  service  called ' Navigraph ', which  is  available  here https://www.navigraph.com/FmsDataManualInstall.aspx .

## PART 3 -FLIGHT PLAN &amp; PRE-START

## PLANNING THE FLIGHT

## FUEL

For a flight of approx. 200 nm ,  fuel  planning can be estimated with the following formula:

## Imperial Units

Fuel for flight = (Number of 100 nm legs) x (7000 lbs)

= 2 x 7000 lbs = 14000 lbs

Reserve Fuel = 17500 lbs

Total Fuel = Fuel for Flight + Reserve Fuel = 31500 lbs

## Metric Units

Fuel for flight = (Number of 100 nm legs) x (3200 kg)

= 2 x 3200 kg = 6400 kg

Reserve Fuel = 8000 kg

Total Fuel = Fuel for Flight + Reserve Fuel = 14400 kg

## FLIGHT ROUTE

The flight route we will take is: EHAM SID GORLO UL980 LOGAN STAR EGLL

## Write this route down.

But what does it all mean? Here is a breakdown of this route:

- Depart from Schiphol Airport (EHAM)
- Follow the SID (Standard Instrument Departure) route from EHAM to GORLO
- Navigate to GORLO VOR
- Follow UL980 airway
- Navigate to LOGAN VOR
- Follow  the  STAR  (Standard  Terminal  Arrival  Route)  from  LOGAN  to EGLL
- Land at Heathrow Airport (EGLL)

777-200LR

## PART 3 -FLIGHT PLAN &amp; PRE-START

## WHAT IS A SID AND A STAR ?

A SID (Standard  Instrument  Departure)  is  a  small  initial  route which  leads  an  aircraft  from  the  runway  they've  just  taken  off from to the first point in his/her intended route. An airport usually has a lot of aircraft departing from it's runways. To save confusion (and for safety), a busy airport will publish standard routes from it's runways to the various routes away from that airport. This way a controller can be sure that even if a steady stream of aircraft is leaving the airport they will all be following in a nice neat line, one behind the other (that's the idea anyhow!).

Standard routes are the preferred method to fly from airport to airport. This is why we use a flight plan generator. Arriving at an airport is just the same. The STARs (STandard Arrival Routes) are also published in chart form and allow you to fly into an airport using standard procedures. This way, less communication is again needed  with  the  controllers  as  (once  you  have  declared  your intention or been given a route to fly by name) the controller and you both know exactly how you are going to approach the airport. The end of the STAR route will normally leave your aircraft at a position  where  controllers  can  give  you  final  instructions  to  set you up for a landing.

SIDs  and  STARs  are  quite  similar  to  highways;  they  have  speed limits and altitude restrictions at certain waypoints to make sure the air traffic is flying safely and on the same trajectory. The FMC (Advanced Flight Management Computer) will automatically try to respect these restrictions.

In other words, you can see SIDs and STARs like road junctions in the sky that lead to other waypoints and airways from or to your desired airport. One airport has many SIDs and STARs.

Typically,  SIDs  and  STARs  are  provided  by  the  ATC  (Air  Traffic Controller). Since we're doing a tutorial, I will just give you the SID and STAR to plug in the FMC.

## PART 3 -FLIGHT PLAN &amp; PRE-START

## CDU/FMC IN A NUTSHELL

Most of the aircraft setup and flight planning will be done with the help of the CDU, which encompasses various systems such as the FMC system.

CDU : Control Display Unit

## MAIN MENU page:

- FMC -&gt; Flight Management Computer
- Fundamental component of a modern airliner's avionics. The FMC is a component of the  FMS  (Flight  Management  System),  which  is  a  specialized  computer  system  that automates a wide variety of in-flight tasks, reducing the workload on the flight crew to the point that modern civilian aircraft no longer carry flight engineers or navigators. A primary  function  is  in-flight  management  of  the  flight  plan.  All  FMS  contain  a navigation database. The navigation database contains the elements from which the flight plan is constructed. The FMS sends the flight plan for display to the Electronic Flight  Instrument  System (EFIS),  Navigation  Display  (ND),  or  Multifunction  Display (MFD).
- SAT -&gt; SATCOM (Satellite Communications)
- Provides aircraft onboard equipment for SATCOM and includes a satellite data unit, a high power amplifier and an antenna with a steerable beam. A typical aircraft SATCOM installation can support data link channels for 'packet data services' as  well  as  voice channels.
- PMDG SETUP -&gt; Setup various aircraft options
- Allows  you  to  configure  aircraft  equipment  installed  on  your  current  airframe, customize  various  parameters  like  display  parameters,  unit  system,  IRS  alignment time,  setup  cold  &amp;  dark  and  other  panel  states,  and  configuration  of  aircraft malfunctions/failures.
- FS ACTIONS -&gt; Flight Simulation Actions
- Allows  you  to  change  fuel  loads,  payloads,  ground  carts  for  power  and  air,  door controls, cabin lights or pushback controls. This is a fictional custom interface built by PMDG as a tool for you to work with.

16c

16a

Note: TO, TO-1, and TO-2 are engine de-ratings. De-rating means that the aircraft uses reduced thrust on takeoff in order to  reduce engine wear, prolong engine life, reduce fuel consumption, and more importantly comply with noise reduction and runway safety requirements. Airbus aircraft have a similar concept called 'FLEX' . 'Flexible temperature' means that the engine controller will force the engine to behave as if outside air temperature was higher than it really is, causing the engines to generate less thrust since higher air temperatures diminish an aeroengine's thrust generating capabilities. FLEX/De-rating is also known in other companies as 'Assumed Temperature Derate ', 'Assumed Temperature Thrust Reduction' or 'Reduced Takeoff Thrust' or 'Factored Takeoff Thrust' .

FMC SETUP -PERF INIT

## NOTE:

The Acceleration, Thrust Reduction and Engine Out Acceleration Heights may seem like plugging random numbers in a computer at first, but there is a valid reason for that. Special heights for Thrust Reduction/Acceleration Height, and OEI Acceleration more often than not are dependent on whether there is a NAP (Noise Abatement Procedure), or if there are some company SOP (Standard  Operating  Procedure)  for  other  factors  like  terrain  clearance.  You  can  consult Jeppesen charts to see what these Noise Abatement procedures are for a particular airport. If no  particular  procedures  are  listed,  you  can  follow  the  standard  procedures  in  the  following document:

ICAO Document 8168, Vol 1, Section 7 - Noise Abatement Procedures Link: http://www.chcheli.com/sites/default/files/icao\_doc\_8168\_vol\_1.pdf

Like I said before, the main wear on engines, especially turbine engines, is heat. If you reduce heat, the engine will have greater longevity. This is why takeoff power is often time limited and a  height  established  that  thrust  is  reduced.  The  difference  between  takeoff  thrust  and  climb thrust may only be a few percent, but the lowering of EGT (Exhaust Gas Temperature) reduces heat and extends engine life significantly.  Acceleration Height is the altitude above ground level (AGL) that a pilot accelerates the aircraft by reducing the aircraft's pitch, to allow acceleration to a speed safe enough to raise flaps and slats, and then reach the desired climb speed. The thrust reduction height is where the transition from takeoff to climb thrust takes place.

Acceleration Height (3,000 ft in our case) is when the nose is to be lowered to allow the aircraft to accelerate. When the aircraft starts accelerating is when the flight crew will retract flaps as per the schedule. Our value was taken directly from the Jeppesen document.

Thrust Reduction Height (1,500 ft in our case) is when the autothrottle will decrease the engine power to the preselected climb thrust; thereby reducing engine wear and tear.  Both may occur simultaneously or at differing heights above ground level.  Both can be configured in the CDU. Our value was taken directly from the Jeppesen document. If no such value was specified, then we'd have to use 800 ft as the minimal value as per the ICAO document.

EO  ACCEL  HT (800  ft  in  our  case)  is  is  the  safe altitude  that  you  can  lower  the  nose  and start accelerating the aircraft in the event of an engine failure. It is based mainly on company SOP or a prescribed procedure (EO SID, as an example), which, unless someone gave you one, you wouldn't know what the SOP value is.  For the purposes of the sim, you can just leave it at 800 ft. Some UK pilots add the airport elevation to this value.

## TAXI

The 777 is  steered  on  the  ground  by  using  a  Nose Gear Steering Tiller.

However,  in  FSX  or  Prepar3d  you  cannot  map  a joystick axis to your tiller: it's a limitation of the sim itself.  In  order  to  steer  the  aircraft,  PMDG  mapped the tiller axis directly on the rudder axis. If you move your rudder pedals while on the ground, the aircraft will have its full steering range as if you were using the tiller.

## TAXI

- Our Flight Number is UAE106 and we spawned at gate F6.
- After we performed pushback from Gate F6, we would typically contact the tower for guidance by saying 'UAE 106, requesting taxi. '
- The tower would then grant you taxi clearance by saying 'UAE 106, taxi to holding position N5 Runway 09 via taxiways Alpha 16 (A16), Bravo (B).
- This means that we will follow the A16 line, then go to B, then turn right to N5 and hold there until we get our clearance for takeoff.
- Throttle up to  maintain a  taxi  speed  of  15  kts  maximum.  Slow  down  to  a maximum of 10 kts before making a 90 deg turn.

4. Once you pass transition altitude (3000 ft in Europe, 18000 ft in the US),  click  on  the  SET  SPD  knob  to  switch  barometric  pressure  to STANDARD pressure in order to use flight levels as a reference. This means you will be using a standard barometric pressure of 29.92 in Hg,  which is also used by other aircraft in the airspace instead of a local  one  given  by  an  Air  Traffic  Controller.  If  pilots don't use  a 'standard' barometric pressure, different aircraft may collide in flight since  they don't use  the  same  pressure  to  define  their  current altitude. This is why higher altitudes are defined as 'flight levels' (i.e. FL250 would be 25000 ft).

PART 7

## Introduction to Autopilot

Many newcomers in the flight simulation world have this  idea  that the autopilot  is  the  answer to  EVERYTHING.  And  I  mean:  e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g.  Spoiler  alert: it's not.  The autopilot is a tool to help you fly to reduce your workload, not a tool to replace the pilot.  The autopilot should be seen as a system that can make your life easier.

Now, why am I saying this? Because some people's knowledge of the autopilot system is summed up in 'hit LNAV and VNAV, then go watch an episode of Mayday while the aircraft does all the work' .  However, there are times where the autopilot can disconnect by itself (i.e. during major turbulence, or when the autopilot is trying to follow a flight profile (SID or STAR) that exceeds safety limitations like bank or pitch angles). The autopilot isn't smart: it will put you in dangerous situations if you ask him to. It will 'blindly' follow whatever is set in the FMC. If there are conflicts or errors in the FMC's flight plan, the AP will gladly follow them even if they don't make sense. This is why you need to constantly be able to fly the aircraft manually if need be.  The autopilot should be seen as a system that can make your life easier. This is why you need to be familiar with the capabilities of the AFDS (Autopilot Flight Director System) and be able to read what the FMA (flight mode annunciator) is telling you.

## Autopilot and Auto-Throttle

The  autopilot  (AP)  is  separated  in  three  main  components:  the  flight  director,  the autopilot  itself  and  the  auto-thrust  system.  Aircraft  pitch  and  attitude  will  help maintain the aircraft on a certain flight path. The throttle will help maintain the aircraft on a certain speed. Depending on the phase of flight (takeoff, climb, cruise, descent, final  approach,  etc.),  the  autopilot  will  react  differently.  During  a  climb,  the  AP  will want to maintain the best, most fuel-efficient climb to save fuel. During a descent, the AP will  want to slow down in order to approach the runway in a low-speed high-lift configuration. The Auto-Thrust system will take control over the engines throttles for you: when AT is engaged, you will see the throttle physically move by itself.

The  AP  has  three  channels:  Left,  Center  and  Right.  The  only  time  three  autopilot channels will engage simultaneously is during automatic landing (AUTOLAND).

## PART 8 -APPROACH &amp; LANDING

## PLANNING DESCENT

So, you've finally  made  it  all  the  way  up  to your  cruising  altitude?  Congrats!  Now,  we have a bit of planning to do.

First, let's introduce you to the ILS (Instrument Landing  System).  This  system  exists  to  guide you during your approach.

- The Localizer is generally an array of antennas that will give you a lateral reference to the center of the runway.

777-200LR

## PART 8 -APPROACH &amp; LANDING

## PLANNING DESCENT

These charts are for the STAR (Standard Terminal Arrival Route) from LOGAN to EGLL. We intend to:

1. Come from LOGAN waypoint
2. Fly  from  LOGAN  towards  the  BIG1E  arrival route.
3. Follow the STAR (BIG1E -&gt; KOPUL -&gt; TANET -&gt; DET -&gt; BIG)
4. Select  an  AIF  (Approach  Initial  Fix)  from  the FMC  database  (in  our  case  CI27L)  and  follow the  approach  towards  the  runway,  guided  by the EGLL airport's ILS (Instrument Landing System).
5. Land at Heathrow  (EGLL) on runway  27L (orientation: 270 Left)

777-200LR

## PART 8 -APPROACH &amp; LANDING

## PLANNING DESCENT

## Final Approach Course: 271

This is the heading you will take when approaching for final landing.

## Minimums in BARO:  277

This  is  the  minimum 'decision altitude' (DA) during landing. If you go lower than 277  ft,  you  are  committed  to  land  no matter  what  happens.  Above  277  ft,  you can still miss your approach and go around.

## ILS Frequency: 109.50 MHz

This  is  the  ILS  system  frequency  you  will track to guide your aircraft for landing.

## Missed Approach Standby

## Frequency: 113.60 MHz

VOR 'LONDON' (LON)  will  be  the  beacon we will track in case we miss our approach and have to go around.

## Missed Approach Procedure

In case we miss our approach, the procedure is to climb straight ahead. When passing  1080  ft,  we  climb  LEFT  on heading 149 to 2000 ft. When passing VOR beacon D6.0 LON, we must climb to 3000 ft and wait for instructions from the tower.

## Transition Level &amp; Transition Altitude

The transition altitude is the altitude at or below which the vertical position of an aircraft is controlled  by  reference  to  altitudes  (6000  ft  on chart).  The  transition  level  is  the  lowest  flight level available for use above the transition altitude.  Our  transition  level  is  defined 'by ATC' (Air  Traffic  Controller).  In  that  case,  a  rule  of thumb is to add 1000 ft to the transition altitude which give us FL070, or 7000 ft.

## Here is a great link to know how to read these charts properly:

https://community.infinite-flight.com/t/howto-read-an-approach-chart/8952

## ATIS Frequency: 128.075

The ATIS (Automatic Terminal Information Service) will  provide  you  valuable  information  including wind direction and speed, and the altimeter setting required for landing.

777-200LR

## PART 8 -APPROACH &amp; LANDING

## PLANNING DESCENT

1. We  have  already  selected  in  our  FMC  our Arrival runway as ILS27L and our arrival STAR 'BIG 1 E' and our Initial Approach Fix 'CI 27 L' at the beginning. Normally, we  do this before  we  begin  our  approach.  See  the 'FMC SETUP -WAYPOINTS' section.
2. In  the  FMC,  go  in  the  RAD  NAV  (Radio Navigation) page. The final approach course for runway 27L (271) will already be automatically  displayed  since  we  entered the  destination  airport.  Press  on  the  LSK next to ILS 109.50/271PARK to select this ILS frequency.
3. The ILS field will now  display  the  VOR frequency, followed by the course (109.50/271).
4. Set MINIMUMS on BARO to 277
5. Set AUTOBRAKE to 3
6. Set Standby Attitude Indicator to APP (approach) mode

## PLANNING DESCENT

7. We must now define VREF for our desired flap setting  (reference landing speed over the runway threshold). Luckily, the FMC (Flight Management Computer) can calculate this speed for us. The only input we need is the aircraft's Gross Weight (Sum of the weights  of  the  aircraft,  fuel,  crew,  passengers,  and  cargo)  when  reaching  EGLL (Heathrow).
8. We will use the following formula to calculate Gross Weight @ Landing:

GW @ Landing = (Current GW) -(Current Fuel -Arrival Fuel) = 427,400 lbs Arrival Fuel @ EGLL = 19,400 lbs (see FMC 'PROGRESS' page at 'EGLL -FUEL') Current Fuel = 24,100 lbs (see TOTAL FUEL indication on EICAS ENG page) Current Gross Weight = 432,100 lbs (see FMC 'INIT/APPROACH REF' page at 'GROSS WT')

## PART 8 -APPROACH &amp; LANDING

## PLANNING DESCENT

9. On the CDU keypad, enter the predicted gross weight at landing '427.4' (for 427,400 lbs) and select the LSK next to 'GROSS WT' to update the VREF values. You should see them change to lower reference airspeed values.
10. Click on the LSK next to '30 ° -137KT' to copy the VREF speed for a Flaps 30 degrees landing configuration.
11. Click on the LSK next to FLAP/SPEED to paste the calculated VREF value.

## PART 8 -APPROACH &amp; LANDING

## PLANNING DESCENT

12. On MCP (Mode Control Panel), set Final Descent Altitude to 2000 ft. The aircraft will not start descending yet because it hasn't reached the T/D (Top of Descent) point.
13. Go in the LEGS page of the FMC and make sure that you have enough distance to perform your approach at a 3 deg glide slope. You can use the following rule of thumb:
3. Required Descent Distance = (Altitude x 3)/1000 + (10 nm for deceleration)
4. = (24000 x 3)/1000 + 10 = 72 + 10 = 82 nm

14. You can consult the EGLL ATIS (Automatic Terminal Information Service) system with the radio to get the altimeter setting.
- a) Consult the EGLL chart and find the Heathrow ATIS Frequency (128.075).
- b) Set VHF-1 STANDBY radio frequency ATIS frequency (128.075)
- c) Click on the Transfer button to set the ATIS frequency to the ACTIVE frequency.
- d) Press the L VHF button on the Audio Select Panel to listen on the VHF-1 active frequency.
- e) You should receive the ATIS automated report on the radio for Schiphol Airport. The reported altimeter setting is 30.00 inches of Hg.
- f) Press the L VHF button on the Audio Select Panel to mute the VHF-1 active frequency once you have the information you need.
15. When  reaching  the  transition  level  of  7000  ft,  click  on  the 'STD' BARO  button  to  set  barometric  pressure  instead  of standard  pressure.  In  our  case,  we  will  use  the  barometric pressure the tower told us (30.00 in Hg).

17. Click on the 'VNAV' FMC page on the CDU and use the NEXT button to reach Page 3/3: ECON DES.
18. Select LSK next to the 'FORECAST' menu.
19. Type '070' for FL070 (7000 ft) on the CDU keypad and click on the LSK next to 'TRANS LVL'.

777-200LR

## PART 8 -APPROACH &amp; LANDING

## DESCENT

1. You will automatically start descending when reaching the T/D point.

NOTE: Alternatively, you can also start your descent a bit earlier in order to do a smoother descent that will be more comfortable for passengers by using the 'DES NOW' mode. This DES NOW mode starts the plane down at a shallow 1000 FPM (feet per minute) until it intercepts the VNAV path. Going from 0 to 1000 FPM is far less noticeable to the passengers than quickly going from 0 to 3000 FPM is. DES NOW is also what you would press if ATC gave you a descent clearance prior to your T/D.

ALTERNATIVE PROCEDURE: When you are about 5-10 nm from the Top of Descent point (T/D), click on the 'VNAV' FMC page on the CDU, select Page 3/3 ECON DES, then select LSK next to 'DES NOW' and click on the EXEC button on the CDU.

2. When reaching FL100, set Landing Lights to ON.

3. Before you reach the last waypoint of the STAR (BIG), the tower should be able to clear us for open descent to 2000 ft. Once you fly over the Deceleration Point (can be monitored on the Navigation Display), your aircraft will start losing speed and will begin your approach.
4. Open up the LEGS page on your FMC and look for the speed restriction at BIG. It says that we cannot fly faster than 220 kts.
5. Set autopilot speed to 220 and the altitude to 2000, then press the MCP Speed button (Speed Intervention) and the MCP Altitude button (Altitude Intervention).

6. Once you are approaching the Approach Fix CI27L, slow down to FLAPS UP speed of 217 kts (indicated on speed tape) by setting the autopilot MCP SPEED to 217. If IAS window is blank, click on the MCP SPEED knob to activate the Speed Intervention functionality.
7. Set Flaps lever to 5 deg
8. Set MCP SPEED to the Flaps 5 Speed (177 kts), as shown on Speed Tape
9. Arm LOC (Localizer) switch

## DESCENT

10. Once you are at least 25 nm from ILS approach (a bit before Approach Fix CI27L), press the 'APP' autopilot mode to arm both LOC (Localizer) and G/S (Glide Slope) modes.
11. Set Flaps lever to 15 degrees
12. Once you are at 3000 ft, set MCP SPEED to the FLAPS 15 speed of 157 kts (indicated on speed tape)

13. Set Navigation Display mode to APP (Approach) to check for ILS localizer and glide slope.
14. When LOC (Localizer) is captured, the PFD will indicate in green that the 'LOC' autopilot mode is active.

15. Set HEADING knob to 271, which is the runway QDM (magnetic heading)
16. When glide slope is captured, the PFD will indicate in green that the 'G/S' autopilot mode is active.
17. Set Navigation Display mode back to MAP
18. Once localizer (lateral guidance) and glide slope (vertical guidance) are both captured, you can now set your autopilot altitude to the Go-Around Altitude of 3000 .

## FINAL APPROACH

1. Once you are at 1500 ft on final approach, set landing gear down.
2. Set Flaps Lever to 30 degrees
3. Arm Speed Brake (you can click on the ARMED text next to the lever)
4. Set MCP SPEED to the VREF+5 speed of (137 + 5) kts (indicated on speed tape). In other words, set the autopilot MCP SPEED to 142.
5. This landing will be done with the Autoland (LAND3).
- When flying at 400 ft, the autopilot will switch to LAND mode in order to set the aircraft in a proper altitude and attitude to flare properly.
- When flying at 50 ft, the autopilot will switch to FLARE mode in order to flare the aircraft to have a smooth touchdown.
- On touchdown, the autopilot will switch to ROLLOUT mode. This mode will keep the aircraft on the runway centerline.

NOTE: If for some reason you decide to do a manual landing instead, a good procedure is to disconnect the Autopilot switch and the Autothrottle switches and follow the flight director to the runway by flying manually. You will then land the aircraft visually. Don't follow the flight directors to touchdown: they're not designed to provide accurate design past this DH (decision height).

## LANDING

1. When you hear an audio cue 'MINIMUMS', this means you have reached your minimal decision altitude. You are now committed to l and.
2. At 20 ft, pull up slightly to reduce rate of descent
3. At 10 ft, throttle back to IDLE
4. On touchdown, push the nose into the ground to improve adherence with the runway and maximize braking (the Autobrake system will already brake for you)

5. Press and hold 'F2' ('Throttle decrease quickly' binding) to deploy thrust reversers until you slow down enough to vacate the runway safely.

The Thrust Reverser lever can be moved by pressing and holding the 'Throttle (decrease quickly)' control mapped to your joystick. Make sure that the 'Repeat' slider is set fully to the right. The default key binding is 'F2'.

Take note that the Reverse Thrust lever can only be engaged if your throttle is at IDLE. The reason for that is a mechanical stopper that prevents you from engaging thrust reversers at high throttle settings.
