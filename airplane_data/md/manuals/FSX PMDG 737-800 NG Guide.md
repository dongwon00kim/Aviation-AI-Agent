## 737-800 NG

## PART 1 -INTRODUCTION

The Boeing  737 is a shortto  medium-range twinjet narrow-body airliner developed and manufactured by Boeing Commercial Airplanes in the United States. Originally developed as a shorter, lower-cost twin-engine airliner derived from the 707 and 727, the 737 has developed into a family of ten passenger models with capacities from 85 to 215 passengers. The 737 is Boeing's only narrowbody airliner in production, with the 737 Next Generation (-700, -800, and -900ER) and the re-engined and redesigned 737 MAX variants currently being built.

The 737 was originally envisioned in 1964. The initial 737-100 made its first flight in April 1967, and entered airline service in February 1968 at Lufthansa. Next, the lengthened 737-200 entered service in April  1968.  In  the  1980s,  Boeing  launched  the  longer -300, -400,  and -500  models,  subsequently referred to as the Boeing 737 Classic series and featuring CFM56 turbofan engines along with wing improvements.

The 737 Next Generation (also known as 'NG' or 'Next Gen') was introduced in the 1990s in response to the A320, with a redesigned, increased span laminar flow wing, upgraded "glass" cockpit, and new interior.  The  737  Next  Generation  comprises  the  four -600, -700, -800,  and -900  models,  with lengths ranging from 102 to 138 ft (31.09 to 42.06 m). Boeing Business Jet versions of the 737 Next Generation  are  also  produced.  The  737  was  revised  again  in  the  2010s  for  greater  efficiency,  with the 737  MAX series  featuring CFM  International  LEAP-1B engines  and  improved winglets.  The  737 MAX entered service in 2017.

Systems wise, the 737 has a lot of parts that were certified in the 1960/70' and had no inherent reason to change over time. Hence this is why you will find a mix of technology throughout the aircraft. The aerospace industry has the saying 'if it isn't broken, don't fix it' .

PMDG simulates the 737 NG 'X' for variants -800 and -900 in the base package and the -600 and -700 in an expansion pack.

FMS (Flight Management System) CDU (Control Display Unit)

- An FMS is a specialized computer system that automates a wide variety of in-flight  tasks,  reducing the workload on the flight crew to the point that modern  civilian  aircraft  no  longer  carry flight  engineers or navigators.  A primary function is in-flight management of the flight plan.
- The FMS is controlled through the CDU physical interface.
- The FMS sends the flight plan for display to the Electronic Flight Instrument System ( EFIS ), Navigation Display ( ND ), or Multifunction Display ( MFD ).

The Thrust Reverser lever can be moved by pressing and holding the 'Throttle (decrease quickly)' control mapped to your joystick. Make sure that the 'Repeat' slider is set fully to the right. The default key binding is 'F2'.

Take note that the Reverse Thrust lever can only be engaged if your throttle is at IDLE. The reason for that is a mechanical stopper that prevents you from engaging thrust reversers at high throttle settings.

## PART 3 -FLIGHT PLAN &amp; PRE-START

## PLANNING THE FLIGHT

In real life, you cannot just fly a 737 wherever and whenever you please. Just like on land, the sky is littered with an intricate network of waypoints and aerial highways. Therefore, it is necessary to plan your flight route and to determine how much fuel you will need to carry in order to reach your destination.

In  order  to  do  this,  we  will  use  a  tool  called 'Online Flight Planner' available here: http://onlineflightplanner.org/

There are a number of fuel planners available online. These estimates may or may not be very accurate. There are specific charts created by Boeing to come up with accurate fuel estimates which are unfortunately not available to the public. Therefore, for the sake of simplicity we will just use a rule of thumb that's good enough for the purpose of this tutorial.

## PART 3 -FLIGHT PLAN &amp; PRE-START 737-800 NG

## PLANNING THE FLIGHT

Today's flight will start from AMSTERDAM-SCHIPHOL (EHAM) and our destination will be LONDON-HEATHROW (EGLL).

Using the 'Online Flight Planner' available here: http://onlineflightplanner.org/  we will enter the Departure airport (EHAM), the Destination airport (EGLL) and the AIRAC Cycle desired (we will use the AIRAC cycle 1108 as explained on the next page).

Click on CREATE PLAN to generate a flight plan.

## PLANNING THE FLIGHT

In aviation,  an Aeronautical Information Publication (or AIP ) is defined by  the International Civil Aviation Organization as a publication issued by or with the authority of a state and containing aeronautical information of a lasting character essential to air navigation. It is designed to be a manual containing thorough details of regulations, procedures and other information pertinent to flying aircraft in the particular country to which it relates. It is usually issued by or on behalf of the respective civil aviation administration. AIPs are kept up-to-date by regular revision on a fixed cycle. For operationally significant changes in information, the cycle known as the AIRAC (Aeronautical Information Regulation And Control) cycle is used: revisions are produced every 56 days (double AIRAC cycle) or every 28 days (single AIRAC cycle). These changes are received well in advance so that users of the aeronautical data can update their flight management systems (FMS). (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeronautical\_Information\_Publication )

In  other  words,  some  Youtube  tutorials  might  show  you flight  routes  with  certain  waypoints  that  got  changed  with  more  recent  AIRAC  updates.  Some  waypoints  or  even  airports  may not  exist  anymore. Therefore, you have two options:

1. Plan your flight using the default AIRAC cycle programmed in the FMC when it was first released by PMDG during early August (period 08) 20 11 (AIRAC cycle 1108 ), which is what we will do for this tutorial. This option is free and simple if you fly alone. However, if you fly with online ATCs in multiplayer that use the latest AIRAC database, you should go for the second option.
2. Plan  your  flight  using  the  latest  AIRAC  cycle.  You  will  need  to  update  your  AIRAC,  SID  and  STAR  database  by  using  a  paid  subscription  service  called ' Navigraph ', which  is  available  here https://www.navigraph.com/FmsDataManualInstall.aspx .

## 737-800 NG

## PART 3 -FLIGHT PLAN &amp; PRE-START

## PLANNING THE FLIGHT

## FUEL

For a flight of approx. 200 nm ,  fuel  planning can  be  estimated with the following formula:

## Imperial Units

Fuel for flight = (Number of 100 nm legs) x (2200 lbs) = 2 x 2200 lbs = 4400 lbs

Reserve Fuel = 5500 lbs

Total Fuel = Fuel for Flight + Reserve Fuel = 9900 lbs Metric Units

Fuel for flight = (Number of 100 nm legs) x (1000 kg)

= 2 x 1000 kg = 2000 kg

Reserve Fuel =

2500 kg

Total Fuel = Fuel for Flight + Reserve Fuel = 4500 kg

## FLIGHT ROUTE

The flight route we will take is:

EHAM SID GORLO UL980 XAMAN L980 LOGAN STAR EGLL

## Write this route down.

But what does it all mean? Here is a breakdown of this route:

- Depart from Schiphol Airport (EHAM)
- Follow the SID (Standard Instrument Departure) route from EHAM to GORLO
- Navigate to GORLO VOR
- Follow UL980 airway
- Navigate to XAMAN VOR
- Follow L980 airway
- Navigate to LOGAN VOR
- Follow the STAR (Standard Terminal Arrival Route) from LOGAN to EGLL
- Land at Heathrow Airport (EGLL)

## 737-800 NG

## PART 3 -FLIGHT PLAN &amp; PRE-START

## WHAT IS A SID AND A STAR ?

A SID (Standard Instrument Departure) is a small initial route which leads an aircraft  from  the  runway  they've  just  taken  off  from  to  the  first  point  in his/her intended route. An airport usually has a lot of aircraft departing from it's  runways. To save confusion (and for safety), a busy airport will publish standard  routes  from  it's  runways  to  the  various  routes  away  from  that airport.  This  way  a  controller  can  be  sure  that  even  if  a  steady  stream  of aircraft is leaving the airport they will all be following in a nice neat line, one behind the other (that's the idea anyhow!).

Standard routes are the preferred method to fly from airport to airport. This is why we use a flight plan generator. Arriving at an airport is just the same. The STARs (STandard  Arrival  Routes)  are  also  published  in  chart  form  and allow  you  to  fly  into  an  airport  using  standard  procedures.  This  way,  less communication  is  again  needed  with  the  controllers  as  (once  you  have declared your intention or been given a route to fly by name) the controller and you both know exactly how you are going to approach the airport. The end of the STAR route will normally leave your aircraft at a position where controllers can give you final instructions to set you up for a landing.

SIDs  and  STARs  are  quite  similar  to  highways;  they  have  speed  limits  and altitude restrictions at certain waypoints to make sure the air traffic is flying safely and on the same trajectory. The FMC (Flight Management Computer) will automatically try to respect these restrictions.

In other words, you can see SIDs and STARs like road junctions in the sky that lead  to  other  waypoints  and  airways  from or to  your  desired  airport. One airport has many SIDs and STARs.

Typically,  SIDs  and  STARs  are  provided  by  the  ATC  (Air  Traffic  Controller). Since we're doing a tutorial, I will just give you the SID and STAR to plug in the FMC.

## PLANNING THE APPROACH  - STAR

These charts are for the STAR (Standard Terminal  Arrival  Route)  from  LOGAN  to  EGLL. We intend to:

1. Come from LOGAN waypoint
2. Fly  from  LOGAN  towards  the  BIG1E  arrival route.
3. Follow the STAR (BIG1E -&gt; KOPUL -&gt; TANET &gt; DET -&gt; BIG)
4. Select an AIF (Approach Initial Fix) from the FMC database (in our case CI27L) and follow the  approach  towards  the  runway,  guided by the  EGLL airport's ILS (Instrumented Landing System).
5. Land  at  Heathrow  (EGLL)  on runway  27L (orientation: 270 Left)

## PLANNING THE FLIGHT - SUMMARY

So there it is! This is more or less all the information you need to plan your flight!

## PART 3 -FLIGHT PLAN &amp; PRE-START

## CDU/FMC IN A NUTSHELL

Most of the aircraft setup and flight planning will be done with the help of the CDU, which encompasses various systems such as the FMC system.

## CDU : Control Display Unit

## MAIN MENU page:

- FMC -&gt; Flight Management Computer
- Fundamental component of a modern airliner's avionics. The FMC is a component of the FMS (Flight Management System), which is a specialized computer system that  automates  a  wide  variety  of  in-flight  tasks,  reducing  the  workload  on  the flight  crew  to  the  point  that  modern  civilian  aircraft  no  longer  carry flight engineers or navigators. A primary function is in-flight management of the flight plan. All FMS contain a navigation database. The navigation database contains the elements from which the flight plan is constructed. The FMS sends the flight plan for  display  to  the Electronic  Flight  Instrument  System (EFIS),  Navigation  Display (ND), or Multifunction Display (MFD).
- ACARS -&gt; Aircraft Communication Addressing and Reporting System, not simulated
- Digital  datalink  system  for  transmission  of  short  messages  between  aircraft  and ground stations via airband radio or satellite.
- DFDAU -&gt; Digital Flight Data Acquisition Unit, not simulated
- Used  by  airliner  operators  to  acquire  data  from  the  aircraft  for  monitoring purposes
- PMDG SETUP -&gt; Setup various aircraft options
- Allows  you  to  configure  aircraft  equipment  installed  on  your  current  airframe, customize various parameters like display parameters, unit system, IRS alignment time,  setup  cold  &amp;  dark  and  other  panel  states,  and  configuration  of  aircraft malfunctions/failures.
- FS ACTIONS -&gt; Flight Simulation Actions
- Allows you to change fuel loads, payloads, ground carts for power and air, door controls, cabin lights or pushback controls. This is a fictional custom interface built by PMDG as a tool for you to work with.

Note: TO, TO-1, and TO-2 are engine de-ratings. De-rating means that the aircraft uses reduced thrust on takeoff in order to  reduce engine wear, prolong engine life, reduce fuel consumption, and more importantly comply with noise reduction and runway safety requirements. Airbus aircraft have a similar concept called 'FLEX' . 'Flexible temperature' means that the engine controller will force the engine to behave as if outside air temperature was higher than it really is, causing the engines to generate less thrust since higher air temperatures diminish an aeroengine's thrust generating capabilities. FLEX/De-rating is also known in other companies as 'Assumed Temperature Derate ', 'Assumed Temperature Thrust Reduction' or 'Reduced Takeoff Thrust' or 'Factored Takeoff Thrust' . 72

## FMC SETUP -PERF INIT

## NOTE:

The Acceleration, Thrust Reduction and Engine Out Acceleration Heights may seem like plugging random numbers  in  a  computer  at  first,  but  there  is a valid reason  for  that.  Special heights  for  Thrust Reduction/Acceleration Height, and OEI Acceleration more often than not are dependent on whether there is a NAP (Noise Abatement Procedure), or if there are some company SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) for other factors like terrain clearance. You can consult Jeppesen charts to see what these Noise Abatement procedures are for a particular airport. If no particular procedures are listed, you can follow the standard procedures in the following document:

ICAO Document 8168, Vol 1, Section 7 - Noise Abatement Procedures Link: http://www.chcheli.com/sites/default/files/icao\_doc\_8168\_vol\_1.pdf

Like  I  said  before,  the  main  wear  on  engines,  especially  turbine  engines,  is  heat.  If  you  reduce  heat,  the engine will have greater longevity. This is why takeoff power is often time limited and a height established that thrust is reduced. The difference between takeoff thrust and climb thrust may only be a few percent, but the lowering of EGT (Exhaust Gas Temperature) reduces heat and extends engine life significantly.  Acceleration Height is the altitude above ground level (AGL) that a pilot accelerates the aircraft by reducing the aircraft's pitch, to allow acceleration to a speed safe enough to raise flaps and slats, and then  reach  the  desired  climb  speed.  The  thrust  reduction  height  is  where  the  transition  from  takeoff  to climb thrust takes place.

Acceleration  Height (3,000  ft  in  our  case)  is  when  the  nose  is  to  be  lowered  to  allow  the  aircraft  to accelerate.  When  the  aircraft  starts  accelerating  is  when  the  flight  crew  will  retract  flaps  as  per  the schedule. Our value was taken directly from the Jeppesen document.

Thrust Reduction Height (1,500 ft in our case) is when the autothrottle will decrease the engine power to the preselected climb thrust; thereby reducing engine wear and tear.  Both may occur simultaneously or at differing heights above ground level.  Both can be configured in the CDU. Our value was taken directly from the Jeppesen document. If no such value was specified, then we'd have to use 800 ft as the minimal value as per the ICAO document.

EO  ACCEL  HT (800 ft in our case) is is the safe altitude that you  can lower the nose  and start accelerating the  aircraft  in  the  event  of  an  engine  failure.  It  is  based  mainly  on  company  SOP  or  a prescribed procedure (EO SID, as an example), which, unless someone gave you one, you wouldn't know what the SOP value is.  For the purposes of the sim, you can just leave it at 800 ft. Some UK pilots add the airport elevation to this value.

## TAXI

The 737 is steered on the ground by using a tiller.

However, in FSX you cannot map a joystick axis to your nosewheel steering tiller: it's a limitation of the sim itself. In order to steer the aircraft, PMDG mapped the tiller axis directly on the rudder axis. If you move your rudder pedals while on the ground, the aircraft will have its full steering range as if you were using the tiller.

PART 5

## TAXI

- Our Flight Number is BAW106 and we spawned at gate F6.
- After  we  performed  pushback  from  Gate  F6,  we  would  typically  contact the tower for guidance by saying 'BAW 106, requesting taxi. '
- The tower would then grant you taxi clearance by saying 'BAW 106, taxi to holding position N5 Runway 09 via taxiways Alpha 16 (A16), Bravo (B).
- This means that we will follow the A16 line, then go to B, then turn right to N5 and hold there until we get our clearance for takeoff.
- Throttle  up  to  maximum  40  %  N1  and  maintain  a  taxi  speed  of  15  kts maximum. Slow down to a maximum of 10 kts before making a 90 deg turn.

## CLIMB

1. When reaching an altitude of 400 ft, engage autopilot by pressing the 'CMD A' button on the MCP. Your aircraft will now follow the 'magenta line' on your navigation display automatically.
2. Press on the VNAV (Vertical Navigation) and LNAV (Lateral Navigation) autopilot mode buttons on the MCP (Main Control Panel) to engage VNAV and LNAV autopilot modes
3. Always synchronize your heading using the HEADING knob on the MCP. This will not steer the aircraft, but it is good practice in case you need to engage other autopilot modes quickly.

## PART 6 -TAKEOFF, CLIMB &amp; CRUISE

## CLIMB

4. Once you pass transition altitude (3000 ft in Europe, 18000 ft in the US), click on the SET SPD knob to switch barometric pressure to STANDARD pressure in order to use flight levels as a reference. This means you will be using a standard barometric pressure of 1013.2, which is also used by other aircraft in the airspace instead of a local one given by an Air Traffic Controller. If pilots don't use a 'standard' barometric pressure, different aircraft may collide in flight since they don't use the same pressure to define their current altitude. This is why higher altitudes are defined as 'flight levels' (i.e. FL250 would be 25000 ft).

PART 7

## Introduction to Autopilot

Many newcomers in the flight simulation world have this idea that on the 737, the autopilot is the answer to EVERYTHING. And I mean: e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g. Spoiler alert: it's not. The autopilot is a tool to help you fly to reduce your workload, not a tool to replace the pilot.

Now, why am I saying this? Because some people's knowledge of the autopilot system is summed up in 'hit LNAV and VNAV, then go watch an episode of Mayday while the aircraft does all the work' .  However, there are times where the autopilot can disconnect by itself (i.e. during major turbulence, or when the autopilot is trying to follow a flight profile (SID or STAR) that exceeds safety limitations like bank or pitch angles). The autopilot isn't smart: it will put you in dangerous situations if you ask him to. It will 'blindly' follow whatever is set in the FMC. If there are conflicts or errors in the FMC's flight plan, the AP will gladly follow them even if they don't make sense. This is why you need to constantly be able to fly the aircraft manually if need be.  The autopilot should be seen as a system that can make your life easier. This is why you need to be familiar with its capabilities and be able to read what the FMA (flight mode annunciator) is telling you.

## Autopilot and Auto-Throttle

The autopilot is separated in three main components: the flight director, the autopilot itself and the auto-thrust system. Aircraft pitch  and  attitude  will  help  maintain  the  aircraft  on  a  certain flight  path.  The  throttle  will  help  maintain  the  aircraft  on  a certain speed. Depending on the phase of flight (takeoff, climb, cruise,  descent,  final  approach,  etc.),  the  autopilot  will  react differently.  During  a  climb,  the  AP  will  want  to  maintain  the best,  most  fuel-efficient  climb  to  save  fuel.  During  a  descent, the AP will want to slow down in order to approach the runway in  a  low-speed high-lift configuration. The Auto-Thrust system will  control the engines for you: when AT is engaged, you will see the throttle physically move by itself.

The  AP  has  two  channels:  A  and  B.  The  only  time  the  two autopilot  channels  will  engage  simultaneously  is  at  G/S  (glide slope) intercept.

## PART 8 -APPROACH &amp; LANDING

## PLANNING DESCENT

So, you've finally made it all the way up to your cruising altitude? Congrats! Now, we have a bit of planning to do.

First, let's introduce you to the ILS (Instrument Landing System).  This  system  exists  to  guide  you  during  your approach.

- The  Localizer  is  generally  an  array  of  antennas  that will  give  you a lateral reference to the center of the runway.
- The  Glide  Slope  station  will  help  you  determine  the descent  speed  you  need  in  order  to  not  smack  the runway in a smoldering ball of fire.

## 737-800 NG

## PART 8 -APPROACH &amp; LANDING

## PLANNING DESCENT

These charts are for the STAR (Standard Terminal Arrival  Route)  from  LOGAN  to  EGLL.  We  intend to:

1. Come from LOGAN waypoint
2. Fly  from  LOGAN  towards  the  BIG1E  arrival route.
3. Follow the STAR (BIG1E -&gt; KOPUL -&gt; TANET &gt; DET -&gt; BIG)
4. Select an AIF (Approach Initial Fix) from the FMC database (in our case CI27L) and follow the approach towards the runway, guided by the  EGLL airport's ILS  (Instrument  Landing System).
5. Land  at  Heathrow  (EGLL)  on runway  27L (orientation: 270 Left)

## 737-800 NG

## PART 8 -APPROACH &amp; LANDING

## PLANNING DESCENT

## Final Approach Course: 271

This is the heading you will take when approaching for final landing.

## Minimums in BARO:  277

This  is  the  minimum 'decision altitude' (DA) during landing. If you go lower than 277  ft,  you  are  committed  to  land  no matter  what  happens.  Above  277  ft,  you can still miss your approach and go around.

## ILS Frequency: 109.50 MHz

This  is  the  ILS  system  frequency  you  will track to guide your aircraft for landing.

## Missed Approach Standby

## Frequency: 113.60 MHz

VOR 'LONDON' (LON)  will  be  the  beacon we will track in case we miss our approach and have to go around.

## Missed Approach Procedure

In case we miss our approach, the procedure is to climb straight ahead. When passing  1080  ft,  we  climb  LEFT  on heading 149 to 2000 ft. When passing VOR beacon D6.0 LON, we must climb to 3000 ft and wait for instructions from the tower.

## Transition Level &amp; Transition Altitude

The transition altitude is the altitude at or below which the vertical position of an aircraft is controlled  by  reference  to  altitudes  (6000  ft  on chart).  The  transition  level  is  the  lowest  flight level available for use above the transition altitude.  Our  transition  level  is  defined 'by ATC' (Air  Traffic  Controller).  In  that  case,  a  rule  of thumb is to add 1000 ft to the transition altitude which give us FL070, or 7000 ft.

2. On  MCP,  set  COURSES  to  Final  Approach Course for runway 27L (271).
3. Set MINIMUMS on BARO to 277
4. Set AUTOBRAKE to 2
5. Set Standby Attitude Indicator to APP (approach) mode
6. Set NAV ACTIVE frequency to ILS frequency (109.50).  Set  frequency  in  NAV  STANDBY window and click the TFR button to move it to the NAV ACTIVE window.
7. Set NAV STANDBY frequency to VOR 'LONDON' (LON) for Missed Approach (113.60 MHz)

## PLANNING DESCENT

8. We must now define VREF for our desired flap setting  (reference landing speed over the runway threshold). Luckily, the FMC (Flight Management Computer) can calculate this speed for  us.  The  only  input  we  need  is  the aircraft's Gross  Weight  (Sum  of  the  weights  of  the aircraft, fuel, crew, passengers, and cargo) when reaching EGLL (Heathrow).
9. We will use the following formula to calculate Gross Weight @ Landing:

GW @ Landing = (Current GW) -(Current Fuel -Arrival Fuel) = 57.4 tons Arrival Fuel @ EGLL = 2.1 tons (see FMC 'PROGRESS' page at 'EGLL -FUEL QTY') Current Fuel = 2.6 tons (see TOTAL FUEL QTY indication on EICAS ENG page) Current Gross Weight = 57.9 tons (see FMC 'INIT/APPROACH REF' page at 'GROSS WT')

15. Click on the 'DESCENT' FMC page on the CDU and select LSK next to the 'FORECAST' menu.
16. Type '70' for FL070 (7000 ft ) on the CDU keypad and click on the LSK next to 'TRANS LVL'.
17. On MCP (Main Control Panel), set Final Descent Altitude to 2000 ft. The aircraft will not start descending yet because it hasn't reached the T/D (Top of Descent) point.
18. Go in the LEGS page of the FMC and make sure that you have enough distance to perform your approach at a 3 deg glide slope. You can use the following rule of thumb:

Required Descent Distance = (Altitude x 3)/1000 + (10 nm for deceleration)

= (24000 x 3)/1000 + 10 = 72 + 10 = 82 nm

## 737-800 NG

## PART 8 -APPROACH &amp; LANDING

## DESCENT &amp; APPROACH

1. You will automatically start descending when reaching the T/D point.

NOTE: Alternatively, you can also start your descent a bit earlier in order to do a smoother descent that will be more comfortable for passengers by using the 'DES NOW' mode. This DES NOW mode starts the plane down at a shallow 1000 FPM (feet per minute) until it intercepts the VNAV path. Going from 0 to 1000 FPM is far less noticeable to the passengers than quickly going from 0 to 3000 FPM is. DES NOW is also what you would press if ATC gave you a descent clearance prior to your T/D.

ALTERNATIVE PROCEDURE: When you are about 5-10 nm from the Top of Descent point (T/D), click on the 'DESCENT' FMC page on the CDU, select LSK next to 'DES NOW' and click on the EXEC button on the CDU.

2. The  FMC will  display  a 'DRAG REQUIRED' message. Don't worry  about  it, it's a miscalculation of the descent path that is there in the real FMC as well.
3. Once  our  descent  profile  is  initiated,  a  speed  restriction  is  calculated.  This  can sometimes  create  conflicts  between  the  calculated  speed  restriction  to  achieve our descent and the speed restrictions already set in place at certain waypoints. As an example, we have a conflict in the FMC displayed by the message 'UNABLE 250 KTS AT D095 L' .
4. If we go in the FMC's 'DESCENT' page, we will find that our descent profile has a restriction of ' 240/FL100 ', which means that we need to fly at 240 kts or below for an altitude of 10000 ft or below.
5. If we go in the FMC's 'LEGS' page, we will find that the restriction ' 250/FL078 ' for waypoint D095L means that we need to fly at 250 kts or below for an altitude of 7800 ft or below.
6. Go  back  to  the FMC's 'DESCENT' page,  enter ' 250 /' on  the CDU's keypad  and click on the LSK next to ' 240/FL100 ' . This will replace the restriction and get rid of the FMC conflict.
7. When reaching FL100, set FIXED LIGHTS to ON and SEAT BELTS light to ON.
8. When reaching the transition level of 7000 ft, click on the 'STD' BARO button to set barometric pressure instead of standard pressure. In our case, we will assume the tower told us to leave the barometric pressure at 1030 hPa.

## PART 8 -APPROACH &amp; LANDING

## SECURING APPROACH

1. Before you reach the last waypoint of the STAR (BIG), the tower should be able to clear us for open descent to 2000 ft. Once you fly over the Deceleration Point (can be monitored on the Navigation Display), your aircraft will start losing speed and will begin your approach.
2. For this descent, we will use the LVL CHG autopilot mode, which requires a SPEED and an ALTITUDE input on the MCP.
3. Open up the LEGS page on your FMC and look for the speed restriction at BIG. It says that we cannot fly faster than 240 kts.
4. Press the LVL CHG button to engage the 'Level Change' autopilot mode and set autopilot speed to 240 and the altitude to 2000.

## PART 8 -APPROACH &amp; LANDING

## SECURING APPROACH

8. Once you are at least 25 nm from ILS approach (a bit before Approach Fix CI27L), press the 'APP' autopilot mode to arm both VOR/LOC (Localizer) and G/S (Glide Slope) modes.
9. Press the 'CMD B' button to arm the Autoland autopilot mode (this mode requires a second autopilot channel). Note: DO NOT ARM CMD B if you plan to do a manual landing.
10. Once you are at 3000 ft, slow down to FLAPS 1 speed of 181 kts (indicated on speed tape) by setting the autopilot SPEED to 181.
11. Set Flaps lever to 5 degrees
12. Set Navigation Display mode to ILS to check for localizer and glide slope.

13. When VOR/LOC is captured, the PFD will indicate in green that the 'VOR/LOC' autopilot mode is active.
14. Set Navigation Display mode back to MAP
15. Set HEADING knob to 271, which is the runway QDM (magnetic heading)
16. When lined up on approach, slow down to FLAPS 5 speed of 161 kts (indicated on speed tape) by setting the autopilot SPEED to 161.
17. When glide slope is captured,/the PFD will indicate in green that the 'G/S' autopilot mode is active.
18. Once localizer (lateral guidance) and glide slope (vertical guidance) are both captured, you can now set your autopilot altitude to the Go-Around Altitude of 3000 .

## PART 8 -APPROACH &amp; LANDING

## FINAL APPROACH

1. Once you are at 1500 ft on final approach, set landing gear down.
2. Set flaps to 15 deg.
3. Slow down to FLAPS 15 speed of 155 kts (indicated on speed tape) by setting the autopilot SPEED to 155.
4. Arm Speed Brake
5. Set all lights ON
6. On overhead panel, set engine start switches to CONT (Continuous Ignition)
7. Once you are at 1000 ft, set Flaps to 30 deg
8. Set speed bug just above VREF to slow down to final approach speed (VREF + wind correction of 5 kts)
9. This landing will be done with the Autoland.
- When flying at 400 ft, the autopilot will switch to LAND mode in order to set the aircraft in a proper altitude and attitude to flare properly.
- When flying at 50 ft, the autopilot will switch to FLARE mode in order to flare the aircraft to have a smooth touchdown.
- On touchdown, the autopilot will switch to ROLLOUT mode. This mode will keep the aircraft on the runway centerline.

NOTE: If for some reason you decide to do a manual landing instead, a good procedure is to disconnect both Autopilot CMD switches and the Autothrottle switch and follow the flight director to the runway by flying manually. You will then land the aircraft visually. Don't follow the flight directors to touchdown: they're not designed to provide accurate design past this DH (decision height).

1. When you hear an audio cue 'MINIMUMS', this means you have reached your minimal decision altitude. You are now committed to l and.
2. At 20 ft, pull up slightly to reduce rate of descent
3. At 10 ft, throttle back to IDLE
4. On touchdown, push the nose into the ground to improve adherence with the runway and maximize braking (the Autobrake system will already brake for you)

5. Press and hold 'F2' ('Throttle decrease quickly' binding) to deploy thrust reversers until you slow down enough to vacate the runway safely.

The Thrust Reverser lever can be moved by pressing and holding the 'Throttle (decrease quickly)' control mapped to your joystick. Make sure that the 'Repeat' slider is set fully to the right. The default key binding is 'F2'.

Take note that the Reverse Thrust lever can only be engaged if your throttle is at IDLE. The reason for that is a mechanical stopper that prevents you from engaging thrust reversers at high throttle settings.
