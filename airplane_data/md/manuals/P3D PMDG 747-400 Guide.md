PART 1

The Boeing 747, nicknamed 'The Queen of the Skies', is an American widebody commercial jet  airliner and cargo  aircraft,  often  referred  to  by  its  original  nickname, "Jumbo Jet". Its distinctive "hump" upper deck along the forward part of the aircraft has made it  one  of  the  most  recognizable  aircraft, and  it  was  the  first  wide-body  airplane  produced. Manufactured  by Boeing's Commercial  Airplane unit  in  the  United  States,  the  747  was originally  envisioned  to  have  150  percent  greater  capacity  than  the Boeing  707, a  common large  commercial  aircraft  of  the  1960s.  First  flown  commercially  in  1970,  the  747  held  the passenger capacity record for 37 years.

In  1963  Boeing  was  among  a  group  of  plane  makers  that  were  competing  for  a  military contract  to  build  a  very  large  transport:  the  CX-HLS.  One  of  the  main  requirements  for  the military transport design was for a nose loading cargo door with clear access to the main deck. The Boeing design featured a bubble atop the fuselage forward of the wing leading edge. The contract went to Lockheed and General Electric to build what was to become the C5 Galaxy. During this time, commercial aviation was growing at a rapid pace. The jet age was finding its feet with the very popular Boeing 707 and Douglas DC8 being the workhorses of the day. Juan Trippe of Pan Am, one of Boeings biggest customers, approached Boeing to press them look at building an aircraft twice the size of the 707 and DC8.

Trippe  advocated  that  a  larger  aircraft  would  be  the  solution  to  the  congestion  at  airports, reducing  the  number  of  relatively  smaller  aircraft  required  to  move  the  same  amount  of people.  In  1965  Boeing  put  together  a  design  team  to  work  on  the  new  airliner  which  was already given the Boeing 747 designation. The proposal Boeing had put forward for the military transport, the CX-HLS, was taken as a start point. Some features were retained, but others such as the high wing design were discarded. The design also had to be future proof. At this time in aviation, it was felt that supersonic travel had every chance of becoming the norm, so Boeing had to take an each way bet. The design team for the Boeing 747 had to come up with an aircraft that met the requirements of airlines who wanted mass passenger movement, but at the same time had the ability to be an effective freighter.

One of main enablers that made such a larger aircraft possible was the advent of high bypass turbofan engines. General Electric had applied the principal to the C5 Galaxy project. The high bypass turbofan delivered twice the power of turbojets which were in use at the time, and used one third less fuel. Pratt and Whitney were also working on this concept and in 1966 Pan AM, Boeing and Pratt and Whitney agreed to develop the JT9D as the powerhouse for the 747. However,  the  variants  simulated  by  PMDG  are  more  modern  and  include  the  Rolls-Royce RB211-524, General Electric CF6-80C2B1F and Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4056 turbofan engines.

## PART 1 -INTRODUCTION

The four-engine 747 uses a double-deck configuration for part of its length and is available in passenger, freighter and other versions. Boeing designed the 747's hump-like upper deck to serve as a first -class lounge or extra seating, and to allow the aircraft to be easily converted to a cargo carrier by removing seats and installing a front cargo door. The 747-400, the most common variant in service, has a high-subsonic cruise speed of Mach 0.85 -0.855 (up to 570 mph or 920 km/h) with an intercontinental range of 7,260 nautical miles (8,350 statute miles or 13,450 km). The  747-400  can  accommodate  416  passengers  in  a  typical three-class  layout,  524  passengers  in  a  typical  two-class  layout,  or  660  passengers  in  a  high -density  one-class configuration.

Boeing expected supersonic airliners -the development of which was announced in the early 1960s -to render the 747 and other subsonic airliners obsolete, while the demand for subsonic cargo aircraft would remain robust well into the future. Though the 747 was expected to become obsolete after 400 were sold, it exceeded critics' expectations with production surpassing 1,000 in 1993. By June 2018, 1,545 aircraft had been built.

PART 1

The 747 is just an incredible aircraft to fly. It feels heavy and does definitely not turn on a dime. The 747 requires careful planning during approaches. The engines are big and powerful, but keep in mind that their response time is longer than you might think.

As Chuck Jodry said on AVSIM in his review of the PMDG 747: 'As you line up the 747 for takeoff, the thrill of flight slowly intensifies as you apply takeoff power and watch as this majestic aircraft  gradually  thunders  down the  runway  before  gracefully  lifting off  into the  skies  above.  With outstanding sound  quality  and  cockpit  shaking  effects,  you can't help  but  for  a  brief moment to feel that you're a real 747 captain. Although a large aircraft of this nature will typically fly on autopilot after the landing gear is retracted, the QOTS II is an aircraft that encourages the user to fly by hand due to its smooth and outstanding flying characteristics. Even with the autopilot turned on; this aircraft gracefully handles adverse weather and is always smooth when responding to any autopilot input by the pilot. '

PART 2

## EPR OR N1? WHAT? WHY? HOW?!?

You  may  be  wondering … but  why  would  an  engine  use  different  units  for  power settings like N1 and EPR?

Pratt &amp; Whitney and Rolls-Royce use the Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR) for engines like the PW4056, while GE Aviation (General Electric) uses the engine Fan Speed (N1) for engines like the CF6. This difference originates from the way the two companies want the pilot to define his thrust reference.

EPR is defined as the ratio between the pressure at the engine outlet and the engine inlet, and is dependent on the prevailing atmospheric conditions as pressure is affected by temperature and aircraft altitude.

- This is a somewhat more accurate indication of thrust reference since it's the result of simple physics: Thrust = Pressure x Area of Application. No matter the condition of the engine, a given EPR in the same atmospheric conditions is guaranteed to deliver the same amount of thrust.
- EPR relies on two pitot probes, and they are susceptible to foreign object damage, such as insects, icing, clogging … which can lead to faulty EPR readings. In multi-spool engines, there is also an issue of stability in control of thrust since filtering of noise from sensors delays response time.

N1 is defined as the speed of the engine compressor or fan, which is independent of the prevailing local atmospheric conditions.

- The N1 sensors are not prone to failure, are more reliable and provide a much better response time. The measurement of speed is a lot more accurate, which allows for excellent stability in control. The N readings do not fluctuate with atmospheric variations, unlike EPR. For this reason, when penetrating a turbulent region in flight, N1 values are used as reference, even if EPR readings are available.
- N1 is a less accurate indication of thrust since it does not take into account engine degradation, which can generate less thrust for the same N1 . However, the presence of an N1 indication can allow the crew to recognize performance degradation.

Fun fact: did you know that the 747 could also be fitted  with  a  fifth  engine  mount?  It  can  carry  an engine out on the wing for transport, but it can't be used to power the aircraft per se. A 747 flown by Qantas  used  this  engine  transportation  method from Sydney to Johannesburg.

## PART 3 -FLIGHT PLAN &amp; PRE-START

## PLANNING THE FLIGHT

In real life, you cannot just fly a 747 wherever and whenever you please. Just like on land, the sky is littered with an intricate network of waypoints and aerial highways. Therefore, it is necessary to plan your flight route and to determine how much fuel you will need to carry in order to reach your destination.

In order to do this, we will use a tool called 'Online Flight Planner' available here: http://onlineflightplanner.org/

There are a number of fuel planners available online. These estimates may or may not be very accurate. There are specific charts created by Boeing to come up with accurate fuel estimates which are unfortunately not available to the public.  Therefore,  for  the  sake  of  simplicity  we  will  just  use  a  rule  of  thumb that's good enough for the purpose of this tutorial.

PART 3

## PLANNING THE FLIGHT

Today's flight will start from AMSTERDAM-SCHIPHOL (EHAM) and our destination will be LONDON-HEATHROW (EGLL).

Using the 'Online Flight Planner' available here: http://onlineflightplanner.org/  we will enter the Departure airport (EHAM), the Destination airport (EGLL) and the AIRAC Cycle desired (we will use the AIRAC cycle 1702 as explained on the next page).

Click on CREATE PLAN to generate a flight plan.

747-400

## PART 3 -FLIGHT PLAN &amp; PRE-START

## PLANNING THE FLIGHT

In aviation,  an Aeronautical Information Publication (or AIP ) is defined by  the International Civil Aviation Organization as a publication issued by or with the authority of a state and containing aeronautical information of a lasting character essential to air navigation. It is designed to be a manual containing thorough details of regulations, procedures and other information pertinent to flying aircraft in the particular country to which it relates. It is usually issued by or on behalf of the respective civil aviation administration. AIPs are kept up-to-date by regular revision on a fixed cycle. For operationally significant changes in information, the cycle known as the AIRAC (Aeronautical Information Regulation And Control) cycle is used: revisions are produced every 56 days (double AIRAC cycle) or every 28 days (single AIRAC cycle). These changes are received well in advance so that users of the aeronautical data can update their flight management systems (FMS). (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeronautical\_Information\_Publication )

In  other  words,  some  Youtube tutorials might show you flight routes with certain waypoints that got changed with more recent AIRAC updates. Some waypoints or even airports may not exist anymore. Therefore, you have two options:

1. Plan your flight using the default AIRAC cycle programmed in the FMC when it was first coded by PMDG during early February, 2017 (period 02) 20 17 (AIRAC cycle 1702 ), which is what we will do for this tutorial. This option is free and simple if you fly alone. However, if you fly with online ATCs in multiplayer that use the latest AIRAC database, you should go for the second option.
2. Plan  your  flight  using  the  latest  AIRAC  cycle.  You  will  need  to  update  your  AIRAC,  SID  and  STAR  database  by  using  a  paid  subscription  service  called ' Navigraph ', which  is  available  here https://www.navigraph.com/FmsDataManualInstall.aspx .

## 747-400

## PART 3 -FLIGHT PLAN &amp; PRE-START

## PLANNING THE FLIGHT

## FUEL

For a flight of approx. 200 nm ,  fuel  planning can be estimated with the following formula:

## Imperial Units

Fuel for flight = (Number of 100 nm legs) x (8200 lbs)

= 2 x 8200 lbs = 16400 lbs

Reserve Fuel = 20500 lbs

Total Fuel = Fuel for Flight + Reserve Fuel = 36900 lbs

## Metric Units

Fuel for flight = (Number of 100 nm legs) x (3700 kg) = 2 x 3700 kg = 7400 kg

Reserve Fuel = 9250 kg

Total Fuel = Fuel for Flight + Reserve Fuel = 16650 kg

## FLIGHT ROUTE

The flight route we will take is: EHAM SID GORLO UL980 LOGAN STAR EGLL

## Write this route down.

But what does it all mean? Here is a breakdown of this route:

- Depart from Schiphol Airport (EHAM)
- Follow the SID (Standard Instrument Departure) route from EHAM to GORLO
- Navigate to GORLO VOR
- Follow UL980 airway
- Navigate to LOGAN VOR
- Follow  the  STAR  (Standard  Terminal  Arrival  Route)  from  LOGAN  to EGLL
- Land at Heathrow Airport (EGLL)

747-400

## PART 3 -FLIGHT PLAN &amp; PRE-START

## WHAT IS A SID AND A STAR ?

A SID (Standard  Instrument  Departure)  is  a  small  initial  route which  leads  an  aircraft  from  the  runway  they've  just  taken  off from to the first point in his/her intended route. An airport usually has a lot of aircraft departing from it's runways. To save confusion (and for safety), a busy airport will publish standard routes from it's runways to the various routes away from that airport. This way a controller can be sure that even if a steady stream of aircraft is leaving the airport they will all be following in a nice neat line, one behind the other (that's the idea anyhow!).

Standard routes are the preferred method to fly from airport to airport. This is why we use a flight plan generator. Arriving at an airport is just the same. The STARs (STandard Arrival Routes) are also published in chart form and allow you to fly into an airport using standard procedures. This way, less communication is again needed  with  the  controllers  as  (once  you  have  declared  your intention or been given a route to fly by name) the controller and you both know exactly how you are going to approach the airport. The end of the STAR route will normally leave your aircraft at a position  where  controllers  can  give  you  final  instructions  to  set you up for a landing.

SIDs  and  STARs  are  quite  similar  to  highways;  they  have  speed limits and altitude restrictions at certain waypoints to make sure the air traffic is flying safely and on the same trajectory. The FMC (Advanced Flight Management Computer) will automatically try to respect these restrictions.

In other words, you can see SIDs and STARs like road junctions in the sky that lead to other waypoints and airways from or to your desired airport. One airport has many SIDs and STARs.

Typically,  SIDs  and  STARs  are  provided  by  the  ATC  (Air  Traffic Controller). Since we're doing a tutorial, I will just give you the SID and STAR to plug in the FMC.

## PLANNING THE FLIGHT - SUMMARY

So there it is! This is more or less all the information you need to plan your flight!

747-400

## PART 3 -FLIGHT PLAN &amp; PRE-START

## CDU/FMC IN A NUTSHELL

Most of the aircraft setup and flight planning will be done with the help of the CDU, which encompasses various systems such as the FMC system.

CDU : Control Display Unit

## MAIN MENU page:

- FMC -&gt; Flight Management Computer
- Fundamental  component  of  a  modern  airliner's avionics.  The  FMC  is  a component  of  the  FMS  (Flight  Management  System),  which  is  a  specialized computer system that automates a wide variety of in-flight tasks, reducing the workload on the flight crew to the point that modern civilian aircraft no longer carry flight engineers or navigators. A primary function is in-flight management of  the  flight  plan.  All  FMS  contain  a  navigation  database.  The  navigation database contains the elements from which the flight plan is constructed. The FMS  sends  the  flight  plan  for  display  to  the Electronic  Flight  Instrument System (EFIS), Navigation Display (ND), or Multifunction Display (MFD).
- ACARS -&gt; Aircraft Communication Addressing and Reporting System
- Digital  datalink  system  for  transmission  of  short  messages  between  aircraft  and  ground  stations  via airband radio or satellite. Such messages can be METAR weather reports.
- SAT -&gt; SATCOM (Satellite Communications)
- Provides  aircraft  onboard  equipment  for  SATCOM  and  includes  a  satellite  data  unit,  a  high  power amplifier  and an  antenna  with  a  steerable beam.  A  typical  aircraft  SATCOM  installation  can  support data link channels for 'packet data services' as well as voice channels.
- CMC -&gt; Central Maintenance Computer
- Maintenance interface to the primary flight control system for the line mechanic. The role of the CMC in the maintenance of the primary flight control system is to identify failures present in the system and to assist in their repair.
- PMDG SETUP -&gt; Setup various aircraft options
- Allows  you  to  configure  aircraft  equipment  installed  on  your  current  airframe,  customize  various parameters like display parameters, unit system, IRS alignment time, setup cold &amp; dark and other panel states, and configuration of aircraft malfunctions/failures.
- FS ACTIONS -&gt; Flight Simulation Actions
- Allows you to change fuel loads, payloads, ground carts for power and air, door controls, cabin lights or pushback controls. This is a fictional custom interface built by PMDG as a tool for you to work with.

## 747-400

## PART 3 -FLIGHT PLAN &amp; PRE-START

## CDU/FMC IN A NUTSHELL

- FMC -&gt; Flight Management Computer
- INIT REF : data initialization or for reference data
- RTE : input or change origins, destination or route
- DEP ARR : input or change departure and arrival procedures
- ATC : displays ATC/ADS-B (Air Traffic Controller/Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast) system status page
- VNAV : input or change vertical navigation path data
- FIX : create reference points (fix) on map display
- LEGS : view or change lateral and vertical data
- HOLD : create and show holding pattern data
- FMC COMM : displays datalink, which is used to send information between aircraft and air traffic controllers when an aircraft is too far from the ATC to make voice radio communication and radar observations possible.
- PROG : shows progression of dynamic flight and navigation data, including waypoint estimated time of arrival, fuel remaining, etc.
- RAD NAV : view or change radio navigation data
- MENU : view the main menu page (see previous page)
- PREV PAGE / NEXT PAGE : Cycles through previous and next page of selected FMC page
- BRT : controls CDU brightness
- EXEC : Makes data modifications active

Sounds complicated? Don't worry, it's much simpler than it looks. We'll see how it works in the tutorial section.

## 747-400

## PART 3 -FLIGHT PLAN &amp; PRE-START

## SET COLD &amp; DARK STATE

In  Prepar3d  or  FSX,  you  will  generally  spawn  with  your  engines running.  A 'cold &amp; dark' start-up  means  that  your  aircraft  is  in  an unpowered state with engines and every other system off. Here is the procedure to spawn in such a state:

1. Spawn like you normally would at Gate F6 in EHAM (departure airport).
2. Go on CDU main menu and reset aircraft to COLD and DARK configuration.

Note: TO, TO-1, and TO-2 are engine de-ratings. De-rating means that the aircraft uses reduced thrust on takeoff in order to  reduce engine wear, prolong engine life, reduce fuel consumption, and more importantly comply with noise reduction and runway safety requirements. Airbus aircraft have a similar concept called 'FLEX' . 'Flexible temperature' means that the engine controller will force the engine to behave as if outside air temperature was higher than it really is, causing the engines to generate less thrust since higher air temperatures diminish an aeroengine's thrust generating capabilities. FLEX/De-rating is also known in other companies as 'Assumed Temperature Derate ', 'Assumed Temperature Thrust Reduction' or 'Reduced Takeoff Thrust' or 'Factored Takeoff Thrust' .

FMC SETUP -PERF INIT

## NOTE:

The Acceleration, Thrust Reduction and Engine Out Acceleration Heights may seem like plugging random numbers in a computer at first, but there is a valid reason for that. Special heights for Thrust Reduction/Acceleration Height, and OEI Acceleration more often than not are dependent on whether there is a NAP (Noise Abatement Procedure), or if there are some company SOP (Standard  Operating  Procedure)  for  other  factors  like  terrain  clearance.  You  can  consult Jeppesen charts to see what these Noise Abatement procedures are for a particular airport. If no  particular  procedures  are  listed,  you  can  follow  the  standard  procedures  in  the  following document:

ICAO Document 8168, Vol 1, Section 7 - Noise Abatement Procedures Link: http://www.chcheli.com/sites/default/files/icao\_doc\_8168\_vol\_1.pdf

Like I said before, the main wear on engines, especially turbine engines, is heat. If you reduce heat, the engine will have greater longevity. This is why takeoff power is often time limited and a  height  established  that  thrust  is  reduced.  The  difference  between  takeoff  thrust  and  climb thrust may only be a few percent, but the lowering of EGT (Exhaust Gas Temperature) reduces heat and extends engine life significantly.  Acceleration Height is the altitude above ground level (AGL) that a pilot accelerates the aircraft by reducing the aircraft's pitch, to allow acceleration to a speed safe enough to raise flaps and slats, and then reach the desired climb speed. The thrust reduction height is where the transition from takeoff to climb thrust takes place.

Acceleration Height (3,000 ft in our case) is when the nose is to be lowered to allow the aircraft to accelerate. When the aircraft starts accelerating is when the flight crew will retract flaps as per the schedule. Our value was taken directly from the Jeppesen document.

Thrust Reduction Height (1,500 ft in our case) is when the autothrottle will decrease the engine power to the preselected climb thrust; thereby reducing engine wear and tear.  Both may occur simultaneously or at differing heights above ground level.  Both can be configured in the CDU. Our value was taken directly from the Jeppesen document. If no such value was specified, then we'd have to use 800 ft as the minimal value as per the ICAO document.

EO  ACCEL  HT (800  ft  in  our  case)  is  is  the  safe altitude  that  you  can  lower  the  nose  and start accelerating the aircraft in the event of an engine failure. It is based mainly on company SOP or a prescribed procedure (EO SID, as an example), which, unless someone gave you one, you wouldn't know what the SOP value is.  For the purposes of the sim, you can just leave it at 800 ft. Some UK pilots add the airport elevation to this value.

48. If  the  &gt;FUEL  TANK/ENG  message  pops up,  it  is  to  notify  you  that  you  need  to configure the tanks such that each TANK is  fueling  an  ENGine  (TANK  per  ENG,  or TANK/ENG). If you look at the FUEL page, you will see that the only pumps running all  four  engines  up  to  this  point  are  the OVRD  pumps  in  MAIN  2  and  MAIN  3. These  pumps  are heaving fuel  out  of these tanks to keep  all four  engines running,  and  the  reason  you're  running all  of  the  engines  off  of  these  tanks  is that  they  can  hold  a  lot  more  fuel  than the outboards (think of the profile of the wing here). Once the inboard and outboard tanks are all at the same level, though, there's no longer a reason to be heaving fuel out of the tanks, so you turn the  OVRD  pumps  off,  and  then  set  the engines  up  in  a  way  that  they  all  draw from  their  own  tank  (this  also  ensures that  if  there's  a  leak  in  a  line  between one  of  the  tanks  and  an  engine,  you're not going to affect more than one engine
49. In  this  tutorial,  FUEL  TANK/ENG  should happen when all tanks get down to being even, below 30.0. Since the FUEL TANK/ENG message has popped up, we will close the FUEL CROSSFEED VALVE switches and all OVERRIDE FUEL PUMP switches to remove this caution.

The 747 is  steered  on  the  ground  by  using  a  Nose Gear Steering Tiller.

However,  in  FSX  or  Prepar3d  you  cannot  map  a joystick axis to your tiller: it's a limitation of the sim itself.  In  order  to  steer  the  aircraft,  PMDG  mapped the tiller axis directly on the rudder axis. If you move your rudder pedals while on the ground, the aircraft will have its full steering range as if you were using the tiller.

- Our Flight Number is BAW106 and we spawned at gate F6.
- After we performed pushback from Gate F6, we would typically contact the tower for guidance by saying 'BAW 106, requesting taxi. '
- The tower would then grant you taxi clearance by saying 'BAW 106, taxi to holding position N5 Runway 09 via taxiways Alpha 16 (A16), Bravo (B).
- This means that we will follow the A16 line, then go to B, then turn right to N5 and hold there until we get our clearance for takeoff.

## PART 6 -TAKEOFF, CLIMB &amp; CRUISE

## CLIMB

1. When reaching an altitude of 400 ft, engage autopilot by pressing either the CMD LEFT, CMD CENTER or CMD RIGHT button on the MCP. Your aircraft will now follow the 'magenta line' on your navigation display automatically since we already armed the VNAV and LNAV modes.
2. Make sure the VNAV (Vertical Navigation) and LNAV (Lateral Navigation) autopilot mode buttons on the MCP (Mode Control Panel) are engaged
3. Always synchronize your heading using the HEADING knob on the MCP. This will not steer the aircraft, but it is good practice in case you need to engage other autopilot modes quickly.

4. Once you pass transition altitude (3000 ft in Europe, 18000 ft in the US),  click  on  the  SET  SPD  knob  to  switch  barometric  pressure  to STANDARD pressure in order to use flight levels as a reference. This means you will be using a standard barometric pressure of 29.92 in Hg,  which is also used by other aircraft in the airspace instead of a local  one  given  by  an  Air  Traffic  Controller.  If  pilots don't use  a 'standard' barometric pressure, different aircraft may collide in flight since  they don't use  the  same  pressure  to  define  their  current altitude. This is why higher altitudes are defined as 'flight levels' (i.e. FL250 would be 25000 ft).

12. Once we have reached our first SID target altitude of 6000 ft, vertical autopilot mode will maintain 6000 ft (VNAV ALT mode) unless we set our cruising altitude and engage the VNAV SPD mode.
13. We will now begin our climb to our cruising altitude of 24000 ft. Set the ALTITUDE knob on the MCP (Mode Control Panel) to 24000.
14. Push (left click) the inner ALTITUDE button on the MCP to set new altitude target to the autopilot. Autopilot will now climb to selected altitude using the VNAV SPD mode.

## Introduction to Autopilot

Many newcomers in the flight simulation world have this  idea  that the autopilot  is  the  answer to  EVERYTHING.  And  I  mean:  e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g.  Spoiler  alert: it's not.  The autopilot is a tool to help you fly to reduce your workload, not a tool to replace the pilot.  The autopilot should be seen as a system that can make your life easier.

Now, why am I saying this? Because some people's knowledge of the autopilot system is summed up in 'hit LNAV and VNAV, then go watch an episode of Mayday while the aircraft does all the work' .  However, there are times where the autopilot can disconnect by itself (i.e. during major turbulence, or when the autopilot is trying to follow a flight profile (SID or STAR) that exceeds safety limitations like bank or pitch angles). The autopilot isn't smart: it will put you in dangerous situations if you ask him to. It will 'blindly' follow whatever is set in the FMC. If there are conflicts or errors in the FMC's flight plan, the AP will gladly follow them even if they don't make sense. This is why you need to constantly be able to fly the aircraft manually if need be.  The autopilot should be seen as a system that can make your life easier. This is why you need to be familiar with the capabilities of the AFDS (Autopilot Flight Director System) and be able to read what the FMA (flight mode annunciator) is telling you.

## Autopilot and Auto-Throttle

The  autopilot  (AP)  is  separated  in  three  main  components:  the  flight  director,  the autopilot  itself  and  the  auto-thrust  system.  Aircraft  pitch  and  attitude  will  help maintain the aircraft on a certain flight path. The throttle will help maintain the aircraft on a certain speed. Depending on the phase of flight (takeoff, climb, cruise, descent, final  approach,  etc.),  the  autopilot  will  react  differently.  During  a  climb,  the  AP  will want to maintain the best, most fuel-efficient climb to save fuel. During a descent, the AP will  want to slow down in order to approach the runway in a low-speed high-lift configuration. The Auto-Thrust system will take control over the engines throttles for you: when AT is engaged, you will see the throttle physically move by itself.

The  AP  has  three  channels:  Left,  Center  and  Right.  The  only  time  three  autopilot channels will engage simultaneously is during automatic landing (AUTOLAND).

## Autopilot Parameter Selectors

- IAS MACH Selector:  Sets speed input to aircraft autopilot.
- SEL:  Selects/toggles airspeed unit (IAS (indicated airspeed) vs Mach), usually used above FL260, or 26000 ft
- Heading Selector:  Sets heading input to aircraft autopilot.
- Bank Angle Limit Selector: Sets autopilot bank angle limit
- Altitude Selector: Sets altitude input to aircraft autopilot.
- Vertical Speed (V/S) Selector: Sets vertical speed input to aircraft autopilot.

## Autopilot, Flight Director &amp; Autothrottle Selectors

- Auto-throttle (A/T) ARM Switch : Arms A/T for engagement. Auto-throttle engages automatically when FL CH, V/S, VNAV, ALT HOLD modes are used.
- Flight Director (F/D) Switch: Arms flight director
- CMD L/C/R: Engages selected autopilot channel in selected mode.
- DISENGAGE Bar: Disengages autopilot.

## PART 7 -AUTOPILOT

Autoflight -Thrust/Speed Modes

- THR: Engages auto-throttle in Thrust (THR) mode (selects climb thrust after takeoff or go-around). Mode inhibited under 400 ft altitude.
- SPD: Engages auto-throttle in SPEED mode (maintains IAS/MACH value in display). Speed Selector knob must be pushed to override the speed target of the FMC.

## Autoflight -Vertical Modes

- VNAV: Vertical Navigation mode will follow the vertical components and restrictions of the flight plan entered in the FMC.
- FL CH (Flight Level Change): Aircraft climbs or descends to selected ALTITUDE at selected IAS/MACH
- V/S: Sets Vertical Speed to selected VERT SPEED.
- ALT: Aircraft climbs or descends to target altitude. Altitude Selector knob must be pushed to override the altitude target of the FMC.
- ALT HOLD: Aircraft levels off and holds its current altitude.

## Autoflight -Lateral Modes

- LNAV:  Lateral Navigation mode will follow the lateral components and restrictions of the flight plan entered in the FMC.
- HDG SEL: Heading and Bank Angle selector. Aircraft will roll towards the selected HEADING.
- HDG HOLD: Holds the current aircraft heading.
- LOC:  Tracks VHF Ominidirectional Range (VOR) localizer. Aircraft will only be controlled laterally.

## Autoflight -Vertical + Lateral Mode

- APP: Tracks localizer and glideslope during approach. Aircraft will be controlled laterally and vertically.

## PART 8 -APPROACH &amp; LANDING

## PLANNING DESCENT

So, you've finally  made  it  all  the  way  up  to your  cruising  altitude?  Congrats!  Now,  we have a bit of planning to do.

First, let's introduce you to the ILS (Instrument Landing  System).  This  system  exists  to  guide you during your approach.

- The Localizer is generally an array of antennas that will give you a lateral reference to the center of the runway.

## 747-400

## PART 8 -APPROACH &amp; LANDING

## PLANNING DESCENT

These charts are for the STAR (Standard Terminal Arrival Route) from LOGAN to EGLL. We intend to:

1. Come from LOGAN waypoint
2. Fly  from  LOGAN  towards  the  BIG1E  arrival route.
3. Follow the STAR (BIG1E -&gt; KOPUL -&gt; TANET -&gt; DET -&gt; BIG)
4. Select  an  AIF  (Approach  Initial  Fix)  from  the FMC  database  (in  our  case  CI27L)  and  follow the  approach  towards  the  runway,  guided  by the EGLL airport's ILS (Instrument Landing System).
5. Land at Heathrow  (EGLL) on runway  27L (orientation: 270 Left)

## PART 8 -APPROACH &amp; LANDING

## PLANNING DESCENT

## Final Approach Course: 271

This is the heading you will take when approaching for final landing.

## Minimums in BARO:  277

This  is  the  minimum 'decision altitude' (DA) during landing. If you go lower than 277  ft,  you  are  committed  to  land  no matter  what  happens.  Above  277  ft,  you can still miss your approach and go around.

## ILS Frequency: 109.50 MHz

This  is  the  ILS  system  frequency  you  will track to guide your aircraft for landing.

## Missed Approach Standby

## Frequency: 113.60 MHz

VOR 'LONDON' (LON)  will  be  the  beacon we will track in case we miss our approach and have to go around.

## Missed Approach Procedure

In case we miss our approach, the procedure is to climb straight ahead. When passing  1080  ft,  we  climb  LEFT  on heading 149 to 2000 ft. When passing VOR beacon D6.0 LON, we must climb to 3000 ft and wait for instructions from the tower.

## Transition Level &amp; Transition Altitude

The transition altitude is the altitude at or below which the vertical position of an aircraft is controlled  by  reference  to  altitudes  (6000  ft  on chart).  The  transition  level  is  the  lowest  flight level available for use above the transition altitude.  Our  transition  level  is  defined 'by ATC' (Air  Traffic  Controller).  In  that  case,  a  rule  of thumb is to add 1000 ft to the transition altitude which give us FL070, or 7000 ft.

## Here is a great link to know how to read these charts properly:

https://community.infinite-flight.com/t/howto-read-an-approach-chart/8952

## ATIS Frequency: 128.075

The ATIS (Automatic Terminal Information Service) will  provide  you  valuable  information  including wind direction and speed, and the altimeter setting required for landing.

## 747-400

## PART 8 -APPROACH &amp; LANDING

## PLANNING DESCENT

1. We  have  already  selected  in  our  FMC  our Arrival runway as ILS27L and our arrival STAR 'BIG 1 E' and our Initial Approach Fix 'CI 27 L' at the beginning. Normally, we  do this before  we  begin  our  approach.  See  the 'FMC SETUP -WAYPOINTS' section.
2. In  the  FMC,  go  in  the  RAD  NAV  (Radio Navigation) page. The final approach course for runway 27L (271) will already be automatically  displayed  since  we  entered the  destination  airport.  Press  on  the  LSK next to ILS 109.50/271PARK to select this ILS frequency.
3. The ILS field will now  display  the  VOR frequency, followed by the course (109.50/271).
4. Set MINIMUMS on BARO to 277
5. Set AUTOBRAKE to 3
6. Set Standby Attitude Indicator to APP (approach) mode

7. We must now define VREF for our desired flap setting  (reference landing speed over the runway threshold). Luckily, the FMC (Flight Management Computer) can calculate this speed for us. The only input we need is the aircraft's Gross Weight (Sum of the weights  of  the  aircraft,  fuel,  crew,  passengers,  and  cargo)  when  reaching  EGLL (Heathrow).
8. We will use the following formula to calculate Gross Weight @ Landing:

GW @ Landing = (Current GW) -(Current Fuel -Arrival Fuel) = 511,000 lbs Arrival Fuel @ EGLL = 18,200 lbs (see FMC 'PROGRESS' page at 'EGLL -FUEL') Current Fuel = 24,300 lbs (see TOTAL FUEL indication on EICAS ENG page) Current Gross Weight = 517,100 lbs (see FMC 'INIT/APPROACH REF' page at 'GROSS WT')

## PLANNING DESCENT

9. On the CDU keypad, enter the predicted gross weight at landing '511.0' (for 511,000 lbs) and select the LSK next to 'GROSS WT' to update the VREF values. You should see them change to lower reference airspeed values.
10. Click on the LSK next to '30 ° -137KT' to copy the VREF speed for a Flaps 30 degrees landing configuration.
11. Click on the LSK next to FLAP/SPEED to paste the calculated VREF value.

## PLANNING DESCENT

12. On MCP (Mode Control Panel), set Final Descent Altitude to 2000 ft. The aircraft will not start descending yet because it hasn't reached the T/D (Top of Descent) point.
13. Go in the LEGS page of the FMC and make sure that you have enough distance to perform your approach at a 3 deg glide slope. You can use the following rule of thumb:
3. Required Descent Distance = (Altitude x 3)/1000 + (10 nm for deceleration) = (24000 x 3)/1000 + 10 = 72 + 10 = 82 nm

14. You can consult the EGLL ATIS (Automatic Terminal Information Service) system with the radio to get the altimeter setting.
- a) Consult the EGLL chart and find the Heathrow ATIS Frequency (128.075).
- b) Set VHF-1 STANDBY radio frequency ATIS frequency (128.075)
- c) Click on the Transfer button to set the ATIS frequency to the ACTIVE frequency.
- d) Press the L VHF button on the Audio Select Panel to listen on the VHF-1 active frequency.
- e) You should receive the ATIS automated report on the radio for Schiphol Airport. The reported altimeter setting is 29.86 inches of Hg.
- f) Press the L VHF button on the Audio Select Panel to mute the VHF-1 active frequency once you have the information you need.
15. When  reaching  the  transition  level  of  7000  ft,  click  on  the 'STD' BARO  button  to  set  barometric  pressure  instead  of standard  pressure.  In  our  case,  we  will  use  the  barometric pressure the tower told us (29.86 in Hg).

## DESCENT

1. You will automatically start descending when reaching the T/D point.

NOTE: Alternatively, you can also start your descent a bit earlier in order to do a smoother descent that will be more comfortable for passengers by using the 'DES NOW' mode. This DES NOW mode starts the plane down at a shallow 1000 FPM (feet per minute) until it intercepts the VNAV path. Going from 0 to 1000 FPM is far less noticeable to the passengers than quickly going from 0 to 3000 FPM is. DES NOW is also what you would press if ATC gave you a descent clearance prior to your T/D.

ALTERNATIVE PROCEDURE: When you are about 5-10 nm from the Top of Descent point (T/D), click on the 'VNAV' FMC page on the CDU, select Page 3/3 ECON DES, then select LSK next to 'DES NOW' and click on the EXEC button on the CDU.

2. When reaching FL100, set Landing Lights to ON.

3. Before you reach the last waypoint of the STAR (BIG), the tower should be able to clear us for open descent to 2000 ft. Once you fly over the Deceleration Point (can be monitored on the Navigation Display), your aircraft will start losing speed and will begin your approach.
4. Open up the LEGS page on your FMC and look for the speed restriction at BIG. It says that we cannot fly faster than 240 kts.
5. Set autopilot speed to 240 and the altitude to 2000, then press the MCP Speed button (Speed Intervention) and the MCP Altitude button (Altitude Intervention).

## FINAL APPROACH

1. Once you are at 1500 ft on final approach, set landing gear down.
2. Set Flaps Lever to 30 degrees
3. Arm Speed Brake (you can click on the ARM text next to the lever)
4. Set MCP SPEED to the VREF+5 speed of (137 + 5) kts (indicated on speed tape). In other words, set the autopilot MCP SPEED to 142.
5. This landing will be done with the Autoland (LAND3).
- When flying at 400 ft, the autopilot will switch to LAND mode in order to set the aircraft in a proper altitude and attitude to flare properly.
- When flying at 50 ft, the autopilot will switch to FLARE mode in order to flare the aircraft to have a smooth touchdown.
- On touchdown, the autopilot will switch to ROLLOUT mode. This mode will keep the aircraft on the runway centerline.

NOTE: If for some reason you decide to do a manual landing instead, a good procedure is to disconnect the Autopilot switch and the Autothrottle switches and follow the flight director to the runway by flying manually. You will then land the aircraft visually. Don't follow the flight directors to touchdown: they're not designed to provide accurate design past this DH (decision height).

5. Press and hold 'F2' ('Throttle decrease quickly' binding) to deploy thrust reversers until you slow down enough to vacate the runway safely.

The Thrust Reverser lever can be moved by pressing and holding the 'Throttle (decrease quickly)' control mapped to your joystick. Make sure that the 'Repeat' slider is set fully to the right. The default key binding is 'F2'.

Take note that the Reverse Thrust lever can only be engaged if your throttle is at IDLE. The reason for that is a mechanical stopper that prevents you from engaging thrust reversers at high throttle settings.
