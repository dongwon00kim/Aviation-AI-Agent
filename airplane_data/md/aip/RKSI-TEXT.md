## General  explanation  of  PDU(Pilot  Display  Unit)  \_  Concourse

1.  It  is  the  camera  to  detect  the  approaching  aircraft.
2.  During  the  docking  procedure,  it  visually  represents  the  guidance  information  such  as  aircraft type  and  remaining  distance.
3. It represents the stand centre line. When  the  camera  detects  the  approaching  aircraft, this vertical  bar  is  displayed  to  let  the  pilot  know  the  correct  course.
4.  It  provides  the  azimuth  guidance  information  to  the  pilot.  When  the  aircraft  deviates  from  the stand  centre  line,  this  symbol  is  shown  to  correct  the  direction  which  the  arrow  symbol  points  to.
5.  It  is  the  symbol  of  the  aircraft.

## RKSI  AD  2.20  LOCAL  AERODROME  REGULATIONS

1. Airport  regulations
2. 1.1 Pilots  are  strongly  required  to  monitor  VHF  121.5 MHz  when  flying  within  SEOUL  TMA.
3. 1.2 Pilots  shall  exercise  extreme  caution  to  avoid  penetrating  Prohibited  Area  (P518,  P73A/B,  etc)  or  Special  Use Airspace  (ACMI,  R17,  etc),  especially  when  flying  north  of  R  270  and  R  080  NCN  around  Incheon  INTL  Airport. (Refer  to  RKSI  AD  2.19  Radio  Navigation  and  landing  Aids.)
4. 1.3 Pilots  should  always  make  sure  that  microphones  are  not  stuck  in  the  transmitting  position  before  transmission  in order  to  prevent  frequency  blockage  (stuck  mike)  from  impairing  ATC.

## 1.4 High  Intensity  Runway  Operation(HIRO)

- HIRO  will  be  in  force  when  runway  surface  condition  is  dry  and  adverse  weather  condition  is  not  present.  When HIRO  are  in force, ATC  will inform via ATIS(Phrase  : High Intensity  Runway  Operation  in  force.  Minimum Runway  Occupancy  Time  required)  or  RTF.

## 1.4.1 Landing  Procedures

- a.  During  HIRO  in  force,  pilots  are  strongly  requested  to  use  the  following  preferred  rapid  exit  taxiways  or  vacate the  landing  runway  within  60  SEC  of  timeframe.  Aircraft  unable  to  comply  with  these  procedures  should  notify ATC  as  early  as  possible.
- b. Pilots are encouraged to apply proper deceleration technique take into account the following distance information of rapid exit  taxiway  to  avoid  decelerating  to  taxi  speed  on  midpoint  of  landing  runway  and minimize  runway  occupancy  time.

## 1.4.2 Departure  Procedures

- a. Pilots are strongly encouraged  to  check  the  availability of intersection  departure  before  start-up.  Declared distance  for  intersection  departure  are  detailed  in  AD  2.13  DECLARED  DISTANCES.  For  the  purpose  of performance  calculations  the  standard  intersection  departure  points  are  :
- b.  Intersection  departures  may  be  initiated  by  ATC  to  expedite  traffic  flow.  Pilots  must  advise  ATC  if  they  are  not able  to  comply  with  this  request  to  prevent  additional  delay  or  sequence  change.
- c. ATC  will consider all aircrafts at the RWY  holding  point  as  able  to commence  line-up  and  take-off  roll immediately on receiving clearance from ATC,  unless otherwise instructed. Pilots should note that  ATC expects  pre-departure  cockpit  checks  to  be  completed  prior  to  entering  the  runway  and  take-off  checks  that must  be  made  on  the  runway  are  kept  to  the  minimum  required.  Pilots  not  ready  when  reaching  the  RWY holding  point  shall  advise  ATC  as  early  as  possible  before  reaching  to  RWY  holding  point.
- d.  When  line-up  or  take-off  clearance  is  issued,  ATC  will  expect  and  has  planned  on  seeing  movement  within  10 seconds.
- e. Normally ATC  will apply ICAO  wake  vortex separation minima between successive departures. If more separation  than  prescribed  minima  is  required,  pilot  shall  notify  ATC  before  entering  the  RWY.

・ RWY  15R  -  B6  /  K ・ RWY  33L  -  B1  /  J ・ RWY  16L  -  N6  /  V  /  U ・ RWY  34R  -  N1  /  T

## 1.4.3 Departure  Sequence

- a.  Departures  will  normally  be  cleared  in  the  order  in  which  they  are  ready  for  take-off(First  Come,  First  Served), however  deviations  may  be  made  from  this  principle  to  facilitate  the  maximum  number  of  departures  with  the least  average  delay  considering  following  factors:
- (1)  Types  of  aircraft  and  their  relative  performance;
- (2)  Routes  to  be  followed  after  take-off
- (3)  Any  specified  minimum  departure  interval  between  take-off
- (4)  Need  to  apply  wake  turbulence  separation  minima;
- (5)  Aircraft  which  should  be  afforded  priority;  and
- (6)  Aircraft  subject  to  ATFM  requirements
- b.  For  aircraft  subject  to  ATFM  requirements,  it  is  the  responsibility  of  the  pilot  and  the  operator  to  ensure  that the aircraft is ready  to taxi in time to  meet  any  required  departure time, bearing in mind  that  once  a departure  sequence  is  established  on  the  taxiway  system,  it  can  be  difficult,  and  sometimes  impossible,  to change  the  order.

## 1.5 Preferential  RWY  System

The  runway  33L/R  or  34L/R  is  recommended  to  be  in  use  to  the  extent  of  8 kts  tailwind.  If  unable  to  comply with  this  procedure,  notify  ATC  of  the  reason  20  minutes  prior  to  ETD  or  ETA.  Delay  may  be  possible  depend on  traffic  situation.

- 1.6 Inbound  Cargo  Aircrafts(using  Cargo  Apron)  to  Incheon  Airport  are  required  to  advise  Seoul  Approach  for  runway assignment  that  you  are  a  'cargo'.

## 1.7 Runway  operation  information

| Time(UTC)   | Departure        | Arrival          |
|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| 0000~2359   | 15R/33L, 16L/34R | 15L/33R, 16R/34L |

※ The  above  times  and  runways  in  use  may  be  changed  if  necessary  due  to  ATC  purposes,  scheduled preventive  maintenance  time,  weather,  ground  conditions  and  traffic  volume.

## 1.8 Flight  limitations

1.  The  use  of  this  airport  for  training  purpose  is  prohibited.  The  deliberate  simulation  of  engine  failure  is  not permitted  whilst  on  approach  to  or  departure  from  the  airport.
2.  The  use  of  this  airport  by  light  sports  aircraft,  ultra-light  vehicles  and  lighter  than  air  is  prohibited.

## 2. Apron  control  services

Incheon  Apron  issues  Push-back  or  Taxi  instructions,  approval,  and/or  necessary  information  to  aircraft,  vehicles and  personnel  within  Apron  areas(Apron  1 ․ 2 ․ 3 ․ 4,  cargo  Apron  1 ․ 2  and  maintenance  Apron)  and  deicing  pads.

## 2.1. Transponder

Pilots  should  always  operate  transponders  with  XPDR(and  AUTO  if  available)  except  for  fully  parking  aircraft  on stand.

## 3. Ground  Movement

- 3.1 Airport  Collaborative  Decision  Making(A-CDM)

## 1.  General

- a.  A-CDM  is  a  process  that  allows  air  traffic  controllers,  airport  operators,  aircraft  operators(AO),  ground  handling agents(GHA),  pilots  and  air  traffic  flow  managers  to  exchange  operational  information  and  work  together  to efficiently  manage  operations  at  aerodrome.
- b.  Definitions  Commonly  Used  Terms  in  A-CDM.
- (1)  Target  Off  Block  Time(TOBT)  -  The  time  that  an  AO  or  GHA  estimates  that  an  aircraft  will  be  ready,  all doors  closed, boarding  bridge removed,  push-back  vehicle  available  and  ready  to start up  /  push-back immediately  upon  reception  of  clearance  from  the  ATC.
- (2)  Target  Start  up  Approval  Time(TSAT)  -  The  time  provided  by  ATC  taking  into  account  TOBT,  Calculated Take-Off  Time(CTOT)  and/or  the  traffic  situation  that  an  aircraft  can  expect  startup  /  push-back  approval.
- c.  The  operation  of  A-CDM  at  Incheon  Airport  will  be  phased  due  to  ATC  environmental  restrictions.  TSAT  will not  be  provided  to  all  departure  flights.  The  flights  subject  to  Pre-Departure  Sequencing  are  limited  to  ATFM regulated  flights  during  first  operational  phase.
- d.  TSAT  will  not  be  provided  to  the  aircraft  in  de-icing  operation.
- e.  TOBT  and  TSAT  will  be  displayed  on  VDGS  in  UTC  for  the  improvement  of  A-CDM  operation.

## 2.  A-CDM  Procedures

- a.  Incheon  Airport  A-CDM  Portal  System  will  automatically  calculate  system  TOBT  for  each  departure  flight  taking into  account  the  Estimated  In-Block  Time/Actual  In-Block  Time(EIBT/AIBT),  Minimum  Turnaround  Time(MTTT) and  Estimated  Off  Block  Time(EOBT).
- b.  AO  or  GHA  can  manually  update  the  system  generated  TOBT  from  90  minutes  prior  to  EOBT.
- c.  If  the  prediction  of  departure  readiness  (new  TOBT)  differs  more  than  5  minutes  from  the  previous  TOBT,  AO or  GHA  shall  update  TOBT.
- d.  TOBT  shall  not  deviate  from  EOBT  by  more  than  15  minutes.  If  TOBT  deviates  from  EOBT  by  more  than  15 minutes,  AO  has  to  initiate  an  delay  message.  When  EOBT  is  modified,  TOBT  is  automatically  modified  to  the value  of  EOBT.
- e.  TOBT  shall  be  updated  through  the  following  channels:
- (1)  A-CDM  portal  and  mobile  web;  or
- (2)  Flight  Information  Assistant(FIA)  at  PBB  boarding  rooms
- f.  TOBT  information  is  available  through  the  following  channels:
- (1)  A-CDM  portal  and  mobile  web;  or
- (2)  Flight  Information  Assistant(FIA)  at  PBB  boarding  rooms;  or
- (3)  Visual  Docking  Guidance  System(VDGS);  or
- (4)  Radio  communication  with  AO  or  GHA
- g.  TSAT  will  be  calculated  by  taking  into  account  factors  such  as  TOBT,  CTOT,  Estimated  Taxi-Out  Time(EXOT) and  ATC  separation  standards  etc.  Thus  the  accuracy  of  TOBT  is  vital  to  an  optimal  TSAT.
- h.  AO  or  GHA  are  strongly  encouraged  to  update  TOBT  as  soon  as  any  expected  delay  to  the  aircraft  readiness for  push-back  is  made  available  to  avoid  unnecessary  hold-ups.
- i.  TSAT  information  is  available  through  the  following  channels:
- (1)  A-CDM  portal  and  mobile  web;  or
- (2)  Flight  Information  Assistant(FIA)  at  PBB  boarding  rooms;  or
- (3)  Visual  Docking  Guidance  System(VDGS);  or
- (4)  Radio  communication  with  GHA  or  AO;  or
- (5)  INCHEON  APRON  (in  case  VDGS  is  unserviceable)
3.  Non  A-CDM  Procedures
- a. The non A-CDM  procedure is applicable when  TOBT  and  TSAT  references used in A-CDM  mode  of operations  become  unavailable  due  to  system  issues  or  maintenance.
- b.  If  unable  to  refer  TOBT  through  any  channels,  pilot  shall  contact  INCHEON  DELIVERY  for  ATC  clearance  via voice  RTF  or  Data-link  Departure  Clearance  Service(DCL)  from  EOBT  -10  minutes.
24. 3.2 Procedures  for  start-up  and  push  back
1.  Pilot  shall  ensure  aircraft  is  ready  for  push-back  at  TOBT.
2.  Pilot  shall  maintain  communication  with  the  AO  /  GHA  as  they  are  responsible  for  updating  the  TOBT.  Pilot shall  notify  the  AO  /  GHA  to  update  the  TOBT  if  it  is  expected  to  differ  by  5  minutes  or  more.
3.  ATC  clearance  can  be  requested  via  voice  RTF  or  Data-link  Departure  Clearance  Service(DCL)  from  TOBT  -10 minutes  to  +5  minutes.
4.  ATC  will  update  TSAT  changes  if  any,  before  push-back.  Note  that  TSAT  displayed  on  VDGS  may  not  be  final and  can  be  revised  due  to  en-route  clearance  restrictions,  ground  congestion  or  flow  management.
5.  Pilot  with  TSAT  shall  contact  INCHEON  APRON  to  request  engine  start-up  and  push-back  within  5  minutes  of TSAT  after  obtaining  ATC  clearance.  Pilot  without  TSAT  shall  contact  INCHEON  APRON  after  obtaining  ATC clearance  when  ready  for  start-up  and  push-back.  The  pilot  provide  the  following:
- (1)  Call  sign
- (2)  Gate/Stand  number
- (3)  TSAT  (If  applicable)
6.  INCHEON  APRON  may  swap  push-back  sequencing  based  on  TSAT  and  real-time  readiness  of  aircraft  to maximise  apron  and  runway  capacity  and  to  reduce  the  overall  delay  to  traffic  as  and  when  required.
7.  If  a  flight  is  unable  to  commence  push-back  by  TSAT  +5  minutes  due  to  the  aircraft  being  unready,  ATC clearance  and  TSAT  will  be  cancelled.  Pilot  must  notify  the  AO  /  GHA  to  update  the  TOBT  for  a  new  TSAT before requesting for a new  ATC  clearance. This also applies to aircraft returning back to blocks after push-back.

8.  In  case  of  engine  start-up  with  GPU  at  gates  due  to  APU  malfunction  or  failure,  pilot  needs  to  contact  Incheon Apron  earlier  than  TSAT  window(±  5  minutes)  considering  the  time  required  for  engine  start-up  and  push-back.
9.  All  aircraft  to  be  taxied  within  the  apron  shall  set  their  engine  thrusts  to  idle.  In  case  of  using  breakaway thrust,  it  should  be  minimized,  especially  when  commencing  taxiing  from  stands(NR.  814,  815,  816,  817)  and starting  points(Point  33,  34,  35,  36)  in  Apron  3  for  ground  safety.
10.  Prior  to  request  for  push-back  clearance,  pilots  shall  ensure  the  following  :
-  Push-back  tractor  has  been  connected;
-  Boarding  bridge  is  detached  and  at  stand-by  position;  and
-  Wing  walkers  are  ready  and  positioned  for  push-back.
7. Pilots  shall  not  commence  push-back  unless  approved  by  Incheon  Apron.
11.  The  smaller  aircraft(business  jets)  ingress  and  egress  procedures  at  designated  deicing  pads  shall  follow  the instructions  of  Incheon  Apron.  Deicing  pads  are  self-maneuvering  stands  (i.e.  taxi  out  with  no  push-back).  In case  of  M  North  zone  assigned  not  for  deicing,  aircraft  shall  be  pushed  back  for  departure.
12.  There  are  several  blue  lines  in  Apron  1  and  3
10. Locations  :  Right  behind  Gates  9,  15,  21,  22,  32,  33,  39,  45,  49  in  Apron  1,  and  237,  238,  239,  240,  258, 259,  260,  261  in  Apron  3. The  aircraft  of  those  gates  shall  be  pushed  back  along  blue  line  until  their  nose-wheels  are  on  the  specific  taxilane.
13.  Prior  to  request  for  taxi  clearance,  pilots  shall  ensure  the  following  :
-  Push-back  tractor  has  been  disconnected;
-  Ground  personnel,  vehicles,  equipment,  obstacles  are  clear  of  aircraft;  and
-  Aircraft  is  fully  ready  to  taxi.
15. Pilots  shall  not  commence  taxi  unless  approved  by  Incheon  Apron.
14.  To  avoid  delay  to  other  aircraft  using  'Apron  1  and  3'  area,  aircraft  should  be  ready  to  taxi  as  soon  as  the push-back  manoeuvre  and  engine  start  procedure  are  completed.  The  push-back  for  gate  17,  18,  19,  20,  21, 33,  34,  35,  36  is  onto  taxilane  R7,  for  gate  236R,  237,  238,  239,  240,  241,  257,  258,  259,  260,  261,  261R is  onto  taxilane  R12,  and  for  gate  208R,  290R  is  onto  taxilane  R17  therefore  to  avoid  delays  to  other  traffic  it is  essential  that  the  aircraft  should  be  ready  to  taxi  as  soon  as  the  push-back  manoeuvre  is  completed.  If aircraft  are  unable  to  comply  with  these  procedures,  pilots  shall  immediately  inform  Incheon  Apron  in  order that  alternative  taxi  instructions  may  be  issued  to  other  aircraft.
15.  When  an  aircraft  have  any  problem  which  can't  make  it  taxi  right  after  push  back,  the  pilot  should  report  to Apron  control.  And  then  the  pilot  will  be  instructed  to  return  gate  or  to  move  other  place  to  avoid  blocking taxilanes.
16. Delays may  be expected due to other aircraft to push back or to taxi as distances between aircraft gates/stands  vary.  If  push-back  is  delayed  due  to  apron  traffic  conditions,  TSAT  will  remain  valid  even  if  it exceeds  TSAT  +  5  minutes.  TOBT  needs  not  to  be  updated  for  such  situations.
17.  The  following  tables  describe  the  procedures  for  push-back  of  aircraft  from  gates  with  airbridges  and  stands. Incheon  Apron  will  issue  specific  instructions  to  the  pilot  if  it  is  necessary  to  expedite  traffic  movement. Most  gates  and  stands  have  several  push-back  procedures.  Push-back  instructions  shall  be  issued  including direction (only 4 directions are used) or specific position when  necessary. Incheon Apron will issue a push-back  instruction  according  to  the  use  of  runway  or  certain  traffic  condition.
18.  When  The  aircraft  push  back  onto  taxilane  R2  or  R3  with  facing  south,  the  pilot  shall  be  taxied  with  idle power  for  ground  safety.
19.  The  aircraft  that  have  been  approved  for  push-back  by  Incheon  Apron  must  set  the  Mode  A  code  assigned by  ATC  prior  to  push-back.
20.  The  pilots  and  vehicle  operators  should  look  out  all  directions  as  they  are  instructed  by  the  Incheon  Apron and  also  obey  emergency  stop  instruction  given  by  any  team  member.
21.  The  aircraft  that  are  moving  after  stopping  at  4E  and  5W  must  move  with  minimum  power.

## Remarks

Departure  routes  in  Apron  areas  will  be  issued  in  detail  according  to  runway  in  use  and  traffic  movement condition  by  Incheon  Apron.  Refer  to  RKSI  AD  2-6,  2-8  (Aerodrome  Ground  Movement  Charts).

2.  Aircraft  shall  not  proceed  beyond  the  TCP  without  clearance  from  Incheon  Ground  or  Tower.

- 3.5 Follow  the  Greens(FtGs)  procedures  at  Incheon  INTL  Airport
- 3.5.1 'Follow the Greens' procedures at Incheon INTL Airport is operated to provide pilots with individual visual guidance(green  taxiway  centerline  lights  and  red  Stop  bar  lights)  while  taxiing  during  day  and  night  operations  as well  as  during  periods  of  low  visibility.
- 3.5.2 Aircraft  taxiing  on  maneuvering  area(runway  and  main  parallel  taxiways)  will  be  guided  by  dedicated  individual green  taxiway  centerline  lights  in  front  of  the  aircraft.
- 3.5.3 ATC  will  use the phraseology 'Follow the Greens.....' when  issuing a clearance to pilots to taxi along the directional guidance  provided  by  the  green  taxiway  centerline  lights  to  clearance limit(runway  holding  point  or transfer  of  control  point/TCP  or  stop  bar  lights).
- 3.5.4 When  instructed  to  follow  the  greens  by  ATC,  pilots  are  reminded  of  the  extreme  importance  of  maintaining  a careful  lookout  and  are  at  all  times  responsible  wing  tip  clearance.
- 3.5.5 When  instructed  to  follow  the  greens  by  ATC,  pilots  shall  not  taxi  ahead  if  there  is  no  green  lights  or  red  Stop bar  lights  are  ahead.
- 3.5.6 Pilots  and  drivers  shall  enter/cross  the  runway  or  taxiway  only  when  both  the  following  conditions  are  met.

The  crew  have

- a.  received  positive  ATC  clearance  to  enter/cross  the  runway  or  taxiway,  and
- b.  observed  that  the  red  Stop  bar  lights  are  turned  off.
3. 3.5.7 When  more  than  one  aircraft  taxi  closely  toward  the  common  intersection,  it  is  possible  to  see  more  than  one directional  guidance  ahead  because  the  end  of  proceeding  green  lights  segment  is  still  remaining.
4. 3.5.8 When  more  than  one  directional  guidance  are  provided  ahead  or  hard  to  see  the  guidance  due  to  reflection  of sunlight,  pilots  shall  stop  and  ask  ATC  for  onward  clearance  before  taxiing.
5. 3.5.9 When  more  than  one  aircraft  taxi  toward  the  common  intersection,  ATC  will  continue  turning  on  the  green  lights  to give  priority  to  first  aircraft.  Second  aircraft  will  be  instructed  'GIVE  WAY  TO...../FOLLOW.....'  or  provided  turning on  the  red  Stop  bar  lights.
6. 3.5.10 When  ATC  wants  to  terminate the 'Follow the Greens', ATC  will revert to directional guidance by taxiway information or mandatory  signs/markings.  In  this case, pilots shall navigate their taxi route with reference to signs/markings  on  taxiway.

2.  Engine  on  de-icing  is  available  on  all  de-icing  pads  and  ACFT  types  applicable  for  engine  on  de-icing  depend on  AO  or  GHA.
3.  Technical  de-icing  (landing  gear,  brakes,  inside  LE-  or  TE-flaps,  under  wing,  engine  inlets,  fan  blades  and sensors/  static  ports/  pitot  probes)  should  be  performed  by  engine  off.
4.  For  safety  and  GHA's  operational  reasons(weather  conditions,  etc.),  engine  off  de-icing  can  be  applied.
5.  On  the  de-icing  pads  ACFT  shall  hold  abeam  the  stop  line  which  indicates  the  cockpit  stop  position  or  follow the  advice  of  the  marshaller.
6.  Aircrew  shall  control  the  throttle  carefully,  avoiding  the  exhausted  gas  causing  damage  to  support  personnel  and equipment,  when  aircraft  exit  the  de-icing  stands.
7.  During  the  engine  on  de-icing,  aircrew  shall  keep  the  engine  idle  and  set  the  brake.  ACFT  hold  position  until Pad  Control  give  the  taxi  instruction.
8.  The  detailed  de-icing  procedures  are  given  on  the  'ICN  DE-ICING  ANTI-ICING  PILOT  BRIEF  SHEET'.  A  copy  of the  sheet  can  be  downloaded  from  www.airport.kr/co\_en/4415/subview.do.

Reduced  Runway  Separation  Minima(RRSM)  will  be  applied  between  a  departing  aircraft  and  a  succeeding  landing aircraft  or  between  two  successive  landing  aircraft.

- a.  RRSM  will  be  applied  when  the  following  conditions  exist  :
- (1)  Visibility  of  at  least  5 km  and  ceiling  not  lower  than  1 000 ft;
- (2)  During  the  hours  of  daylight  from  30  minutes  after  local  sunrise  to  30  minutes  before  local  sunset;
- (3)  No  unfavorable  surface  wind  conditions
5. (including  turbulence,  wind  shear,  or  significant  tailwind(greater  than  5 knots),  etc);
- (4)  The  braking  action  shall  not  be  adversely  affected  by  runway  contaminants;
- (5)  The  second  aircraft  will  be  able  to  see  the  first  aircraft  clearly  and  continuously  until  it  is  clear  of  runway.
- b.  Landing  clearance  may  be  issued  to  an  arriving  aircraft  while  the  runway  is  still  occupied  provided  that  there  is reasonable  assurance  that  the  following  separation  distance  will  exist  when  the  arriving  aircraft  crosses  the runway  threshold.  :
- (1)  Landing  following  Landing

Preceding  aircraft  has  landed  and  has  passed  at  least  2 400 m  from  the  threshold  of  the  landing  runway,  is in  motion  and  will  vacate  the  runway  without  backtracking;

- (2)  Landing  following  Departure

Preceding  aircraft  is/will  be  airborne  and  has  passed  at  least  2 400 m  from  the  threshold  of  the  landing  runway.

- c. ATC will provide traffic information when issuing the landing clearance. The following ICAO standard phraseology  examples  will  be  used  :
-  '(Call  sign),  PRECEDING  B747  VACATING  RUNWAY/ABOUT  TO  VACATE/LANDING  ROLL,  CLEARED  TO  LAND.'
-  '(Call  sign),  DEPARTING  A321  AHEAD  ABOUT  TO  ROTATE,  CLEARED  TO  LAND.'
14. Restriction  on  the  taxilane  R17  over  bridge
1.  All  aircraft  shall  taxi  at  speed  of  less  than  15 kt  on  Taxilane  bridge  R17  (Taxilane  R17  over  bridge)  to  ensure safe  movement.
2.  ICAO  Code  C  and  D  aircraft  could  be  restricted  for  taxiing  on  the  bridge  R17  during  60 ~ 70 kt  of  wind  speed.
3.  All  aircraft  could  be  restricted  for  taxiing  on  the  bridge  R17  during  not  less  than  70 kt  of  wind  speed.

## RKSI  AD  2.22  FLIGHT  PROCEDURES

1. IFR  Procedure
2. 1.1 IFR  ATC  Clearance

The  following  procedures  are  established  for  all  turbo  jet  departures  from  Incheon  International  Airport  :

1.  IFR  ATC  clearance  may  be  obtained  by  Voice  RTF  or  datalink  Departure  clearance  Service(DCL)(via  ARINC (623)).
2.  Pilot  shall  contact  INCHEON  DELIVERY  via voice  RTF  or  Data-link  Departure  Clearance  Service(DCL)  from TOBT  -10  minutes(in  case  of  NON  A-CDM,  EOBT  -10  minutes)  to  +5  minutes  and  report  the  following information.  If  initial  call  takes  to  place  too  early,  Clearance  Delivery  will  ask  the  pilot  to  call  again  at  TOBT -10  minutes.  In  case  of  DCL,  reject  message  will  be  received.  (refer  RKSI  AD  2.20  3.1  A-CDM)
- a.  Aircraft  identification
- b.  Destination
- c.  Gate  or  stand  number
- d.  ATIS  code
3.  In  cases  where  ATC  clearance  is  received  via  DCL,  Pilot  should  follow  restrictions  in  the  remarks  of  ATC Clearance  and  acknowledge  them  within  5 minutes.

AIRAC  AIP  AMDT  6/24

Effective  :  1600UTC  7  AUG  2024

4.  If  unable  to  commence  push-back  by  TSAT  +5  minutes(flight  with  TSAT)  or  within  10  minutes  after  receiving ATC  clearance(flight  without  TSAT)  due  to  the  aircraft  being  unready,  ATC  clearance  will  be  cancelled.  Pilot shall  contact  again  INCHEON  DELIVERY  for  clearances.  (Refer  RKSI  AD  2.20  3.2)

## 1.2 Speed  Restrictions

1.  All  aircraft  shall  not  exceed  250 kt  IAS  below  10 000 ft  in  SEOUL  TMA,  unless  otherwise  authorized  by  ATC. If  unable  to  comply  with  this  speed  restriction,  state  minimum  speed  acceptable  to  ATC.
2.  ATC  will  use  'NO  ATC  SPEED  RESTRICTIONS'  RTF  phraseology  to  remove  MAX  250 kt  IAS  below  10 000 ft.
3.  speed  control  under  radar  vector  :
- a.  When  arriving  traffic  is  being  sequenced  under  radar  direction,  ATC  typically  will  apply  the  following  speed control  :
-  Initial  approach  phase  :  210 kt  IAS
-  Base  leg/HDG  to  final  approach  :  180 kt  IAS
-  When  established  on  final  approach  :  180 kt  to  160 kt  IAS
-  Thereafter  to  5 DME  :  160 kt  IAS
- b.  These  speed  restrictions  are  essential  for  smooth  and  safe  operations  at  high  traffic  loads.  If  an  aircraft does  not  comply  with  these  speed  instructions,  the  aircraft  may  have  to  be  excluded  from  the  planned approach  sequence.
- c.  When  ATC  use  'RESUME  NORMAL  SPEED'  RTF  phraseology,  it  means  that  the  previously  issued  speed restriction  by  ATC  is  cancelled  and  a  pilot  can  resume  an  aircraft's  preferred  speed.  Pilot  shall  note  that  it does  not  mean  the  removal  of    MAX  250 kt  IAS  within  SEOUL  TMA.

## 1.3 Fuel  Dumping  Area

Fuel  Dumping  Area  is  established  within  SEOUL  TMA  as  follows  :

1.  AREA

BELTU(37 ° 12 ' 18 " N  125 ° 47 ' 59 " E)  :  Inbound  HDG  097,  Left  turns,  1  MIN  leg (ATC  instruction  :  Hold  west  of  BELTU,  on  HDG  097,  1  MIN  leg,  left  turns)

PY036(37 ° 12 ' 28 " N  126 ° 02 ' 24 " E)  :  Inbound  HDG  097,  Left  turns,  1  MIN  leg (ATC  instruction  :  Hold  west  of  PY036,  on  HDG  097,  1  MIN  leg,  left  turns)

2.  ALTITUDE  :  At  or  above  6 000 ft
3.  SPEED  :  230 kt  IAS  or  less
4.  Area/Altitude  may  be  changed  by  pilot  request,  traffic  condition  or  any  other  safety  reason.
4. 1.4 Visual  approach  and  Independent  Visual  Approach(IVA)
1.  Visual  approach  may  be  initiated  by  ATC  or  approved  upon  pilot  request  on  traffic  permitting  basis  when weather  as  follows;
- a.  Ceiling  :  At  or  above  2 500 ft
- b.  Visibility  :  Not  less  than  5 km
2.  Independent  Visual  Approach(IVA)  will  be  used  at  Incheon  International  Airport(IIA).  This  procedure  requires accurate  and  consistent  application  of  the  pilot  procedures  and  responsibilities.

## a.  Application

- 1)  IVA  will  be  used  during  parallel  runway  operations  when  the  visibility  is  not  less  than  5 km  and  the  ceiling is  at  or  above  2 500 ft.
- 2)  IVA  will  be  initiated  by  ATC  when  the  pilot  reports  visual  runway  and/or  preceding  aircraft  while  turning  to the  final  or  flying  on  the  localizer  course.
- 3)  Pilots  will  be  notified  by  ATIS  or  RTF  using  the  phrase.  'EXPECT  ILS  APPROACH  THEN  INDEPENDENT VISUAL  APPROACH  WHEN  VISUAL.'

## b.  ATC  Procedures

- 1)  ATC  will  give  IVA  expectation  and  assigned  RWY  to  the  flight  crew  at  initial  contact.  If  no  objection,  ATC will  consider  that  has  been  accepted.
- 2)  ATC  will  provide  standard  surveillance  separation  until  cleared  for  an  independent  visual  approach  or  visual separation  applied.
- 3)  ATC  will  allow  the  aircraft  to  intercept  the  extended  centerline  of  the  landing  runway  at  an  angle  of  not greater  than  30  degrees.
- 4)  ATC  will  use  'CLEARED  INDEPENDENT  VISUAL  APPROACH'  phraseology  when  issue  approach  clearance.
- 5)  If  preceding  aircraft  type  is  SUPER(e.g.  A380),  IVA  clearance  will  not  be  issued  to  succeeding  aircraft.
- 6)  After IVA clearance is issued or visual separation is applied, ATC  will not apply any other type of separation  with  aircraft  on  the  adjacent  final  approach  course.
- 7)  If  necessary,  ATC  will  inform  traffic  information  of  other  relevant  aircraft  on  adjacent  final  approach  course.

## c.  Pilot  procedures

- 1)  Fly  accurate  assigned  heading  to  final  and  do  not  pass  through  assigned  runway  extended  centerline, unless  otherwise  instructed  by  ATC.
- 2)  Other  aircraft  will  be  operating  on  the  adjacent  approach.
- 3)  Accurately  track  the  extended  runway  centerline.
- 4)  After  received  final  radar  heading  at  an  angle  of  not  greater  than  30  degrees,  pilots  shall  intercept  the localizer  of  landing  RWY  unless  previously  instructed  to  cross  extended  centerline  when  radio  contact  is temporary  impossible(e.g.  radio  failure,  congestion  or  blocked).
- 5)  Report  preceding  aircraft  and/or  RWY  in  sight  as  soon  as  possible.
- 6)  If  a  pilot  does  not  report  visual  preceding  aircraft,  RWY  or  adjacent  aircraft,  the  controller  may  vector  the aircraft  away  from  the  final  approach  for  sequencing  for  a  dependent  parallel  approach.
- 7)  Comply  with  speed  restriction(160 kt  to  5 NM  from  THR).  If  unable  to  comply  with  speed  restriction,  inform ATC  immediately.

8)

- Do  not  intentionally  deviate  from final  approach  course.  Pilots  are  strongly  recommended  to  track  on normal  instrument  approach  course  until  landing.
- 9)  In  the  event  of  deviation  from  final  approach  course,  maintain  own  separation  from  aircraft  on  adjacent final  approach  course.
- 10)  When  avoiding  action  is  initiated,  advise  ATC  immediately.
- 11)  Pilots  should  commence  an  ILS  missed  approach  procedure  of  the  assigned  RWY  in  case  of  a  go-around.

## 1.5 Assignment  of  STAR  or  SID

This  information  will  help  pilots  during  preflight  planning  to  select  a  STAR  or  SID.  It  may  be  changed  if  necessary due  to  ATC  purposes,  weather,  ground  conditions  and  traffic  volume.

3.  Use  of  SID  /  STAR
- a.  Pilot  shall  note  that  adherence  to  SID  /  STAR  level  restrictions  are  critical  for  aircraft  separation  in  SEOUL TMA.  For  ATC  separation,  pilots  are  strongly  encouraged  to  check  whether  he  or  she  can  comply  with  level restrictions  of  SID(before  airborne)  /  STAR(before  passing  subsequent  waypoint)  or  not.
- b.  If  unable  to  comply  with  any  restrictions  depicted  on  SID  or  STAR,  pilot  shall  notify  ATC  as  early  as  possible.
- c.  To  eliminate  safety  risk  due  to  a  mismatch  between  ATC  and  pilot  expectations,  ATC  will  provide  aircraft  with explicit  indications  with  regard  to  what  is  expected  in  terms  of  speed  and  level  at  all  times  using  'CANCEL (LEVEL/SPEED)  RESTRICTIONS'  or  'COMPLY  WITH  (LEVEL/SPEED)  RESTRICTIONS'  RTF  phraseology.

## 1.6 Readback  of  ATC  clearance

1.  The  pilot  shall  read  back  always  to  ATC  safety-related  parts  of  ATC  clearances  for  at  least  the  following  items;
- a.  ATC  route  clearances
- b.  Clearances  and  instructions  to  enter,  land  on,  take  off  from,  hold  short  of,  cross,  taxi  and  backtrack  on  any  runway
- c.  Runway-in-use,  altimeter  settings,  SSR  codes,  level  instructions,  heading  and  speed  instructions
2.  Other  clearances  or  instructions,  including  conditional  clearances,  shall  be  read  back  or  acknowledged  in  a manner  to  clearly  indicate  that  they  have  been  understood  and  will  be  complied  with.
6. 1.7 CDO(Continuous  Descent  Operation)  PROCEDURE  FOR  INCHEON  AD
1.  The  CDO  procedures  are  in  place  for  all  aircraft  flying  on  Y644,  Y722,  G585(Y685)  and  G597(Y697)  inbound  to Incheon  international  airport  to  ensure  efficient  arrival  and  approach  operation  as  far  as  possible  during  specified  time.
2.  ATC  instructions
9. Incheon  or  Daegu  ACC  will  instruct  the  aircraft  to  perform  CDO  when  it  enter  Incheon  FIR,  as  follows  :
-  Phraseology
11. controller  :  (Call  sign),  Cleared  CUN(yecheon)  2M  arrival.  Descend  via  STAR  to  7 000.
12. ※ The  above  instruction(Phraseology)  may  be  changed  if  necessary.
3.  Pilots  should  report  ATC  when  leaving  the  altitude  of  the  Top  of  Descent(TOD).
-  Phraseology pilot  :  Incheon  control,  (Call  sign),  Now  leaving. ※
15. Reference  point  of  descending  :  ENPIL(IAF)  at  7 000 ft
4.  Pilots  may  maintain  the  ECON(Economical)  SPEED  on  the  FMS,  unless  ATC  advises  otherwise.
5. If the CDO  procedure  is  not  possible due  to an emergency,  weather  conditions and  traffic an alternate instruction  will  be  issued  by  ATC  or  pilot  can  request  it.
18. 1.8 Initial  Radio  Call  Procedures  with  SEOUL  APPROACH
1.  When  instructed  to  "CONTACT",  pilot  shall  Squawk  IDENT  and  report  callsign,  ACFT  type(including  series)  and ATIS  code.
20. e.g.)  'Seoul  Approach,  ABC123,  Boeing  738,  information  'A'.'
2.  When  instructed  to  "MONITOR  or  STAND  BY  FOR",  pilot  shall  Squawk  IDENT  and  keep  silent  until  ATC initiate  call.

2. Bird  migration  and  concentrations  in  the  vicinity  of  the  airport
- a.  Bird  migration  occurs  during  spring,  fall  and  winter  periods.  The  greatest  degree  of  activity  is  observed  during the following periods : whole of March ~ end of April(Spring migration), early of October ~ early December(winter migration). Weather conditions may affect bird migration on movements during different periods  of  the  year.
- b.  Spring  and  Autumn
4. In  this  period  a  large  flock  of  birds,  especially  shorebirds  is  resting  on  the  remnant  of  mudflats  at  high  tide. And  at  low  tide  they  are  moving  and  scattered  to  forage  their  foods.  Most  of  their  movement  flight  is  occurred on  the  ground  surface  or  below  about  200 ft. The  population  of  shorebirds  reaches  approximately  6 000 ft  at  one  time  in  spring.  Generally  the  number  of birds  is  more  in  spring  than  autumn  but  on  the  contrary  in  the  vicinity  of  airport  bird  activity  is  more  frequent in  autumn.

## c.  Winter

- There  are  two  ponds  that  are  located  respectively  NW  &amp;  SW  of  airport  at  the  distance  of  about  4 km  from  the runway.
- Most  of  ducks  inhabit  at  these  ponds  in  winter  and  the  flock  size  of  one  site  is  less  than  400  individuals.  The largest  group  of  birds  are  Coots  and  about  1 000.  These  use  this  pond  as  resting  site  and  only  a  few  species feeds  in  the  water.  The  movement  of  ducks  is  not  related  the  tide  and  they  are  flying  low  (200 ft)  to  sea around  the  pond.
- d.  In  order  to  reduce  the  wildlife  hazard  in  the  vicinity  of  runway  wildlife  control  activities  are  being  lasted  24h and  include  siren,  threat  of  shotgun,  visual  scares  and  habitat  managements.
