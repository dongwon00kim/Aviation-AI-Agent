## 2. VFR  Approach  Procedure

Aircrafts  arriving  in  seoul  airbase  with  VFR  or  passing  through  should  contact  with  SEOUL  APPROACH  or  SEOUL GCA  outside  of  15 NM  from  seoul  airbase.  Aircrafts  should  approach  with  permission  of  arrival  and  radar  service support  following  VFR  approach  procedure.  (except  all  foreign  and  civil  aircraft) 서울기지에 VFR로 입항 및 통과비행하는 항공기는 서울기지 15NM 밖에서 서울접근관제소 혹은 서울GCA와 교신하여 입항허가 및 Radar service 지원 하에 해당하는 VFR 접근절차에 따라 접근한다. (모든 외래항공기 및 민항기는 제외)

## a.  Fixed-wing  Aircraft

- 1)  Approach  from  north  and  northeast  to  VRP(VFR  report  point)  :  Aircrafts  should  enter  VRP("E/F/H"  PT)  via  "O" PT.  And  aircrafts  approaching  from  "E"  or  "F"  PT  via  "O"  PT  should  do  Initial  or  Straight  in  approach.
2. (RWY  20/19  :  "E"  PT,  RWY  02/01  :  "F"  PT) PT)  접근함을 원 접근을  원칙으로
3. 북쪽, 북동쪽에서 시각보고지점으로 입항하는 항공기 : " O " PT를  경유  시각보고 지점까지( " E/F/H " 칙으로 한다. 필요에 의하여 " O " PT에서 " E,  F " PT를  경유하여  진입  시  INITIAL  또는 Straight  in 한다.

(RWY 20/19 : " E " PT,  RWY  02/01 : " F " PT)

- 2)  Approach  from  south,  southeast  and  east  to  VRP  :  Aircrafts  should  enter  east  downwind  via  "H"  PT.  And aircrafts  approaching  from  "E"  or  "F"  PT  via ' H ' PT  should  do  Initial  or  Straight  in  approach. (RWY  20/19  :  "E"  PT,  RWY  02/01  :  "F"  PT)
2. 남쪽, 남동쪽, 동쪽에서 시각보고지점으로 입항하는 항공기 : " H " PT를  경유  동편장주로 진입을 원칙으로 한다. 필 요에 의하여 " H " PT에서 " E,  F " PT를 경유하여 진입 시 INITIAL 또는 Straight  in 접근을 원칙으로 한다. (RWY 20/19 : " E " PT,    RWY  02/01  : " F " PT)
- 3)  Approach  from  west  to  VRP Aircrafts  should  approach  by  IFR  flight.  When  VFR  approach  is  needed,  approach  via  "E",  "F"  or  "H"  PT  by Seoul  APP  Control. 서쪽에서 입항시는 IFR 입항을 원칙으로 하며 VFR 입항이 필요시 서울 APP 관제하에 " E,  F " 또는 " H " PT로 진입한다.

Fixed-wing  aircraft  shall  depart  under  IFR  basically.  But  if  it  is  unable  to  do  so,  notify  Control  tower  of  the  proposed departure  route  before  take-off  and  then  follow  the  VFR  procedures  under  the  support  of  RADAR  Service  by  Seoul Approach  Control.

고정익 항공기는 IFR 출항을 원칙으로 하나, 부득이한 경우 비행 예정 진로를 이륙 전 관제탑에 통보하고 서울접근관 제소의 RADAR  SERVICE 지원 하에 해당 VFR 접근절차에 따라 출항한다.

## a.  For  Fixed-wing  Aircraft

Climb  HDG  023°(When  RWY  01/02  in  use)  or  HDG  190°(When  RWY  19/20  in  use)  until  reaching  1 000 ft (instrument  altitude),  then  turn  right  and  fly  to  the  east  until  reaching  2 500  ft  and  then  direct  to  the  mission  area. HDG  023°(RWY  01/02) 및 HDG  190°(RWY  19/20 )로 이륙하여 계기고도 1 000 ft 이상에서 동쪽으로 선회하여 2 500 ft 에서 공역으로 향한다. 서울 접근관제소와 교신 시까지 고도 3 500 ft 를 유지한다.

- b.  Helicopters
- 1)  When  RWY  19/20  in  use

When  flying  to  the  North,  fly  along  the  Geoungbu  Expressway  via  CP  "J".  When  flying  to  the  South, fly  along  the  Geoungbu  Expressway  at  1 000 ft  or  fly  to  IP  "B"  via  CP  "J"  and  CP  "C". 북쪽으로 비행 시에는 CP  "J" 을 경유하여 경부고속도로를 따라 CP  "D" 로 비행하고 , 남쪽으로 비행 시에는 경부고속도로를 따라 1 000 ft 로 비행하거나 CP  "J" 및 CP  "C" 를 경유하여 IP  "B" 로 비행한다 .

- 2)  When  RWY  01/02  in  use When  flying  to  the  North,  fly  to  CP  "A"  or  CP  "D".  When  flying  to  the  South,  fly  along  Downwind  leg after  take-off  and  then  proceed  to  IP  "B"  via  CP  "B"  and  CP  "J". 북쪽으로 비행 시에는 CP  "A" 또는 CP  "D" 로 비행하고 , 남쪽으로 비행 시에는 이륙 후 서편 DOWNWIND 를 따라 IP  "B" 또는 CP  "J" 및 CP  "C" 를 경유하여 IP  "B" 로 비행한다 .
- 3)  When  there  are  no  Seoul  Air  Base  flight  missions(holiday  or  after  completing  flight  on  weekday),  pilots  who  are intending  to  transit  over  noise  complaints  area  shall  fly  at  2 000 ft  after  getting  permission  from  the  control  tower if  weather  conditions  are  at  or  above  flight  visibility  3 SM/ceiling  2 500 ft. 서울기지 비비행 ( 휴무일 , 주중비행 종료 후 ) 시 소음민원지역 상공을 통과해야 할 경우 기상조건이 운고 2 500 ft, 비행시정 3 SM 이상이면 관제탑의 허가를 득한 후 고도를 2 000 ft 로 비행한다 .

## 4. Control  Zone  Transition  Procedure  for  Helicopters  Using  the  Geoungbu  Expressway

- a.  Transition  from  the  south  to  the  north

After  initial  contact  at  "SOUTH"  point,  fly  along  the  Gyeongbu  Expressway  via  IP  "B",  then  report  over  CP  "D" unless  otherwise  instructed  by  ATC  to  fly  via  CP  "C"  and  CP  "J". "SOUTH"  PT 에서 첫 교신하여 CP  "C" 와 CP  "J"(CG306425) 을 경유하라는 관제지시가 있지 않는 한 IP  "B" 를 경유 하여 고속도로를 따라 CP  "D" 에서 보고한다 .

- b.  Transition  from  the  north  to  the  south

After  passing  CP  "D",  fly  along  the  Gyeongbu  Expressway,  then  report  over  IP  "B"  unless  otherwise  instructed  by ATC  as  fly  via  CP  "C"  and  CP  "J". CP  "D" 를 통과 후 CP  "J" 와 CP  "C" 로 경유하는 관제지시가 있지 않는 한 경부고속도로를 따라 비행 후 IP  "B" 에 서 보고한다 .

- c.  Avoidance  of  the  noise  complaints  area.

When  there  are  no  Seoul  Air  Base  flight  missions(holiday  or  after  completing  flight  on  weekday),  pilots  who  are intending  to  transit  over  noise  complaints  area  shall  fly  at  2 000 ft  after  getting  permission  from  the  control  tower if  weather  conditions  are  at  or  above  flight  visibility  3 SM/ceiling  2  500 ft. 서울기지 비비행 ( 휴무일 , 주중비행 종료 후 ) 시 소음민원지역 상공을 통과해야 할 경우 기상조건이 운고 2 500 ft, 비행시정 3 SM 이상이면 관제탑의 허가를 득한 후 고도를 2 000 ft 로 비행한다 .

## 5. Caution

- a.  When  flying  for  SEOUL  BASE  Inbound(outbound),  all  pilots  shall  be  careful  of  the  LOTTE  SUPERTOWER  with the  height*  of  570 m  AMSL(1 870 ft)  which  is  located  6 332.6(4 333.9) ft  right  side  from  3.1(3.2) NM  on  final RWY 20(RWY  19). 서울기지  입 ․ 출항시 ,  570 m  AMSL(1 870 ft) 높이 * 의  롯데슈퍼타워를  주의해야  한다 .  World  Tower 의  위치는 RWY 20(RWY  19) 시단에서 3.1(3.2) NM 지점 우측 6 332.6(4 333.9) ft 에 위치하고 있다 .
- b.  Every  helicopter  taking  off  from  Helipad  (Samsung  Medical  Center,  Seoul  Asan  Medical  Center,  etc)  located  in Seoul  control  zone  should  follow  the  P-73  VFR  flight  procedure,  contacting  with  the  Seoul  control  tower  during flight.  However,  If  a  mutual  agreement  is  signed,  the  procedure  specified  in  the  agreement  shall  be  followed. 서울 관제권 내 위치한 헬리패드 ( 삼성서울병원 , 서울아산병원 등 ) 에서 이륙하는 모든 헬기는 이륙 후 P-73 시계비 행로 비행절차를 준수하며 , 서울 관제탑과 교신하여 비행한다 . 단 , 상호 합의서가 체결된 경우 합의서에 명시된 절 차를 따른다 .
