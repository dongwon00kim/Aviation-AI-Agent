1.  Diagram  of  Central,  East,  North  and  West  Apron

## 2. Ground  Procedure

- 2.1 Airport  Collaborative  Decision  Making
1.  General
- a.  A-CDM  is  a  process  that  allows  air  traffic  controllers,  airport  operators,  aircraft  operators(AO),  ground handling  agents(GHA),  pilots  and  air  traffic  flow  managers  to  exchange  operational  information  and  work together  to  efficiently  manage  operations  at  aerodrome.
- b.  Definitions  commonly  used  terms  in  A-CDM
- 1)  Target  Off  Block  Time(TOBT)  -  The  time  that  an  AO  or  GHA  estimates  that  an  aircraft  will  be  ready, all  doors  closed,  boarding  bridge  removed,  push-back  vehicle  available  and  ready  to  start  up/push-back immediately  upon  reception  of  clearance  from  the  ATC.
- 2)  Target  Start  up  Approval  Time(TSAT)  -  The  time  provided  by  ATC  taking  into  account  TOBT,  Calculated Take  off  Time(CTOT)  and/or  the  traffic  situation  that  an  aircraft  can  expect  start-up/push-back  approval.
- c.  The  operation  of  A-CDM  at  Gimpo  airport  will  be  phased  due  to  ATC  environment  restrictions.  TSAT  will not  be  provided  to  all  departure  flights.  The  flights  subject  to  Pre-Departure  Sequencing  are  limited  to ATFM  regulated  flights  during  first  operational  phase.

## 2.  A-CDM  Procedures

- a.  Gimpo  Airport  A-CDM  portal  system  will  automatically  calculate  system  TOBT  for  each  departure  flight  taking into  account  the  Estimated  In-Block  Time/Actual  In-Block  Time(EIBT/AIBT),  Minimum  Turnaround  Time(MTTT) and  Estimated  Off  Block  Time(EOBT).
- b.  AO  or  GHA  can  manually  update  the  system  generated  TOBT  from  90  minutes  prior  to  EOBT.
- c.  If  the  prediction  of  departure  readiness  (new  TOBT)  differs  more  than  5  minutes  from  the  previous  TOBT, AO  or  GHA  shall  update  TOBT.
- d.  TOBT  shall  not  deviate  from  EOBT  by  more  than  5  minutes.  If  TOBT  deviate  from  EOBT  by  more  than  5 minutes,  AO  or  GHA  shall  update  EOBT.  When  EOBT  is  updated,  TOBT  is  automatically  modified  to  the value  of  the  new  EOBT.
- e.  TOBT  shall  be  updated  through  the  following  channels  :
- 1)  A-CDM  portal  or  mobile  web  (https://cdm.airport.co.kr)
- 2)  Flight  Information  Assistant(FIA)  at  PBB  boarding  rooms
- f.  TOBT  information  is  available  through  the  following  channels  :
- 1)  A-CDM  portal  and  mobile  web
- 2)  FIDS  at  PBB  boarding  rooms
- 3)  Radio  communication  with  GHA  or  AO
- g.  TSAT  will  be  calculated  by  taking  into  account  factors  such  as  TOBT,  CTOT,  Estimated  Taxi-Out  Time(EXOT) and  ATC  separation  standards  etc.  Thus  the  accuracy  of  TOBT  is  vital  to  an  optimal  TSAT.

## 3.  Non  A-CDM  Procedures

- a.  The  Non  A-CDM  procedure  is  applicable  when  TOBT  and  TSAT  references  used  in  A-CDM  mode  of operations  become  unavailable  due  to  system  issues  or  maintenance.
- b.  If  unable  to  refer  TOBT  through  any  channels,  pilot  shall  contact  Gimpo  Delivery(121.975 MHz)  for  ATC clearance  at  least  10  minutes  prior  to  ETD(EOBT).

## 2.2 Procedures  for  start-up  and  push-back

1.  Before  start-up  and  push-back
- a.  Pilot  shall  ensure  aircraft  is  ready  for  push-back  at  TOBT.
- b.  Pilot  shall  maintain  communication  with  the  AO  /  GHA  as  they  are  responsible  for  updating  the  TOBT. Pilot  shall  notify  the  AO  /  GHA  to  update  the  TOBT  if  it  is  expected  to  differ  by  5  minutes  or  more.
- c.  ATC  will  update  TSAT  changes  if  necessary,  before  push-back.  Note  that  TSAT  provided  by  ATC  may  not be  final  and  can  be  revised  due  to  en-route  clearance  restrictions,  ground  congestion  or  flow  management.
- d. Before  pilot  request  engine  start-up  and  push-back,  pilot  shall  check  the  following  from  ground  crews(ground handler,  aircraft  maintenance)  :
- 1)  Aircraft  doors  are  closed  (include  cargo  door).
- 2)  Boarding  bridge  (or  step  car)  removed.
- 3)  Push-back  vehicle  connected  and  ready  to  push  (applicable  when  aircraft  needs  push-back).
- 4)  Connection  between  pilot  and  GHA  should  be  maintain,  if  unable  advise  Gimpo  Apron.
- 5)  Including  vehicles  on  GSE  road,  there  is  no  hazard  to  start-up  and  push-back  around  the  aircraft.
*  Note  :  The  pilot  shall  not  ask  the  Gimpo  Apron  for  start-up  and  push-back  until  its  safety  check-up  is  fully confirmed.  If  there  are any  elements  posing  a  potential  failure,  the  pilot  can  ask  the  Gimpo Apron  for  push-back  only.  After  moving  and  standing  the  aircraft  at  a  safety  area,  the  pilot  can ask  the  engine  start  up.

## 2.  Request  start-up  and  push-back

- a.  Pilot  shall  contact  Gimpo  Apron(130.875 MHz)  to  request  engine  start-up  and  push-back  and  provide  the  following  :
- 1)  Call  sign
- 2)  Gate  or  stand  number
- 3)  TSAT  (if  applicable)
- b.  Push-back  approval  is  valid  for  1  MIN.  Push-back  is  therefore  to  begin  promptly  after  approval.
- c.  Push-back  for  Central  &amp;  East  Apron

Aircraft  stands  NR.  124~125,  NR.  131~134  will  be  pushed  back  for  code  letter  "E"  aircraft.

- 1)  RWY  14L/R  in  use

Aircraft  will  be  pushed  back  to  face  northwest  unless  otherwise  instructed  by  ATC.

- 2)  RWY  32R/L  in  use Aircraft  will  be  pushed  back  to  face  southeast  unless  otherwise  instructed  by  ATC.
- d.  Push-back  for  North  Apron
- 1)  Aircraft  stands  NR.  31~36  will  be  pushed  back  to  face  southwest  unless  otherwise  instructed  by  ATC.
- 2)  Aircraft  stands  NR.  37~39,  NR.  304~307  will  be  pushed  back  to  face  southeast  unless  otherwise instructed  by  ATC.
- 3)  Aircraft  stands  NR.  221~241  will  be  pushed  back  to  face  northeast  unless  otherwise  instructed  by  ATC.
- 4)  Aircraft  stands  NR.  201~205,  209  will  be  pushed  back  to  face  northeast  for  code  letter  "E"  aircraft unless  otherwise  instructed  by  ATC.

## 3.  After  start-up  and  push-back

- a.  All  aircraft  to  be  taxied  within  the  apron  shall  fix  their  thrusts  on  an  idle.  In  case  of  using  breakaway thrust,  it  should  be  used  to  a  minimum.  Especially  when  all  aircraft  push  back  from  ACFT  stands(NR.  37, 38,  39)  and  commence  taxiing  onto  taxilane  P4  or  N3  in  North  Apron,  the  pilot  shall  be  taxied  with  idle power  for  ground  safety.
- b.  If  an  aircraft  have  any  problem  with  taxiing  right  after  push-back,  the  pilot  should  report  to  Apron  control. And  then  the  pilot  will  be  instructed  to  return  the  gate  or  to  move  other  places  to  avoid  blocking  taxilanes.

## 4.  Others

- a.  Gimpo  Apron  may  swap  push-back  sequence  based  on  TSAT  and  real-time  readiness  of  aircraft  to  maximize apron  and  RWY  capacity  and  to  reduce  the  overall  delay  of  traffic  as  and  when  required.

## 2.3 Ground  Holding  Procedures

1.  Each  holding  point  uses  a  five-letter  alphabetical  code  to  identify  the  specific  holding  location  for  ground  aircrafts on  P  taxiway.
2. The  specific  holding  points  are  illustrated  as  below.  (Refer  to  AD  2-5  Ground  movement  charts.)
2.  Unless  otherwise  instructed,  aircraft  should  follow  the  instructions  by  ATC  as  below.

| NR.   | Holding Point                 | Name [Pronunciation]   | Coordinates            | ATC Phraseology       | Information sign   |
|-------|-------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|
| ①     | 'P3' taxiway Hold short point | BOKUM [ 보쿰 ]           | 37°33'19"N 126°48'02"E | "Hold short of BOKUM" |                    |
| ②     | 'RD' taxiway Hold short point | NUNPI [ 눈피 ]           | 37°33'28"N 126°47'51"E | "Hold short of NUNPI" |                    |
| ③     | 'R' taxiway Hold short point  | SAMKU [ 샘쿠 ]           | 37°33'38"N 126°47'38"E | "Hold short of SAMKU" |                    |

## 2.4 Procedures  for  vehicles  towing  aircraft

1.  Ground  crews  of  vehicles  required  to  tow  aircraft  should  not  assume  that  the  ATC  is  aware  that  an  aircraft  is  to  be  towed. 항공기 견인 차량의 운전자는 항공기가 견인되고 있다는 상황을 관제기관이 알고 있다고 가정해서는 안 된다 .
2.  Ground  crews  must  ensure  that  the  area  around  the  aircraft  is  clear  of  vehicles,  equipment,  and  other  OBST for  safe  and  smooth  aircraft  movements.  If  it  is  unable  to  maintain  safety  distance  despite  ATC  instruction,
3. ground  crews  must  stop  immediately  and  inform  ATC. 지상운전자는 항공기의 안전하고 원활한 이동을 위해 차량 , 장비 그리고 다른 장애물로부터 항공기 주변의 안전을 확인하여야 한다 . 관제기관의 지시에도 불구하고 안전거리가 확보되지 않을 시 , 지상운전자는 즉시 견인차량을 멈추고 관제기관에 통보하여야 한다 .
3.  In  order  to  avoid  any  confusion,  and  as  an  aid  to  identification,  ground  crews  should  state  the  position  and where  applicable  the  operator,  of  the  aircraft  to  be  towed  and  readback  instructions  from  ATC. 지상운전자는 혼돈을 방지하고 식별을 돕기 위해 위치 및 운영자를 명시하여야 하며 , 관제기관의 지시를 복창하여야 한다 .
4.  The  performance  and  maneuverability  of  ground  vehicles  is  obviously  reduced  when  towing  aircraft  and  this is  taken  into  account  when  instructions  to  such  vehicles  are  issued. 항공기 견인 시 , 견인차량의 성능과 기동성이 상당히 떨어지므로 이 사실을 고려하여 해당 차량에게 지시하여야 한다 .

## 2.5 Departure  routes  and  Transfer  of  Control  Points(TCP)

1.  Unless  otherwise  instructed,  aircraft  should  use  the  following  routes  :
2.  Aircraft  shall  not  proceed  beyond  the  TCP  without  instruction  from  ATC.
3.  These  operation  can  be  changed  by  traffic  condition,  weather  condition  or  any  other  safety  reason.

## 2.6 Arrival  routes  and  Transfer  of  Control  Points(TCP)

1.  Unless  otherwise  instructed,  aircraft  should  use  the  following  routes  :
2.  Aircraft  shall  not  proceed  beyond  the  TCP  without  instruction  from  ATC,  except  in  the  follwing  cases  for rapid  vacating  of  the  RWY.
- a.  When  RWY  14  in  use,  aircraft  inbound  for  P1  /  P2  /  P3  will  normally  be  instructed  to  hold  on  P1  /  P2  /  P3 (hold  short  of  R)  after  vacating  both  RWY  by  Gimpo  Ground  for  smooth  RWY  operation.
- b.  When  RWY  32R  in  use,  aircarft  bound  for  P6  will  normally  be  instructed  to  taxi  via  "Route  1"  after vacating  RWY  by  Gimpo  Tower  for  smooth  RWY  operation.
3.  These  operation  can  be  changed  by  traffic  condition,  weather  condition  or  any  other  safety  reason.

## RKSS  AD  2.22  FLIGHT  PROCEDURES

## 1. IFR

## 1.1 IFR  ATC  CLEARANCE

The  following  procedures  are  established  for  all  turbo  jet  departures  from  Gimpo  International  Airport  :

1.  Aircraft  shall  contact  Clearance  Delivery  and  provide  the  following  information  5  minutes  prior  to  start-up  or push-back.
- a.  Aircraft  Identification
- b.  Type  of  aircraft
- c.  Destination
- d.  Proposed  flight  level
- e.  Gate  or  stand  number
- f.  ATIS  code
2.  If  aircraft  fails  to  push  back  or  taxi  within  15  minutes  after  receipt  of  ATC  clearance,  pilot  should  notify  ATC except  when  :
- a.  Start-up  or  push-back  is  delayed  due  to  traffic  on  the  ground,  or
- b.  Aircraft  departure  is  restricted  by  means  of  release  time  or  the  same  altitude/route  separation.

## 1.2 SPEED  RESTRICTION

1.  All  aircraft  shall  not  exceed  250 kt  IAS  below  10 000 ft  in  SEOUL  TMA,  unless  otherwise  authorized  by  ATC. If  unable  to  comply  with  this  speed  restriction,  state  minimum  speed  acceptable  to  ATC.
2.  ATC  will  use  'NO  ATC  SPEED  RESTRICTIONS'  RTF  phraseology  to  remove  MAX  250 kt  IAS  below  10 000 ft.
3.  speed  control  under  radar  vector  :
- a.  When  arriving  traffic  is  being  sequenced  under  radar  direction,  ATC  typically  will  apply  the  following  speed  control  :
-  Initial  approach  phase  :  210 kt  IAS
-  Base  leg/HDG  to  final  approach  :  180 kt  IAS
-  When  established  on  final  approach  :  180 kt  to  160 kt  IAS
-  Thereafter  to  7.5  DME  :  160 kt  IAS

- b.  These  speed  restrictions  are  essential  for  smooth  and  safe  operations  at  high  traffic  loads.  If  an  aircraft does  not  comply  with  these  speed  instructions,  the  aircraft  may  have  to  be  excluded  from  the  planned approach  sequence.
- c.  When  ATC  use  'RESUME  NORMAL  SPEED'  RTF  phraseology,  it  means  that  the  previously  issued  speed restriction  by  ATC  is  cancelled  and  a  pilot  can  resume  an  aircraft's  preferred  speed.  Pilot  shall  note  that it  does  not  mean  the  removal  of  MAX  250 kt  IAS  with  in  SEOUL  TMA.

## 1.3 Fuel  Dumping  Area

Fuel  Dumping  Area  is  established  within  SEOUL  TMA  as  follows.

1.  AREA  :  A  circle  with  a  radius  of  5 NM  centered  on  R  264  NCN/D22,  R  278  SEL/D45
2.  ALTITUDE  :  At  or  above  6 000 ft
3.  Area/altitude  may  be  changed  by  pilot  request,  traffic  condition  or  any  other  safety  reason.

## 1.4 Visual  Approach

Visual  Approach  may  be  initiated  by  ATC  or  approved  upon  pilot  request  on  traffic  permitting  basis  when;

1.  Ceiling  :  at  or  above  1 000 ft  (reported  weather  by  the  airport)
2.  Visibility  :  not  less  than  5 km  (3 SM)
3.  Circuit  :  west  pattern  only

## 1.5 Use  of  SID  /  STAR

1.  Pilot  shall  note  that  adherence  to  SID  /  STAR  level  restrictions  are  critical  for  aircraft  separation  in  SEOUL TMA.  For  ATC  separation,  pilots  are  strongly  encouraged  to  check  whether  he  or  she  can  comply  with  level restrictions  of  SID(before  airborne)  /  STAR(before  passing  subsequent  waypoint)  or  not.
2.  If  unable  to  comply  with  any  restrictions  depicted  on  SID  or  STAR,  pilot  shall  notify  ATC  as  early  as  possible.
3.  To  eliminate  safety  risk  due  to  a  mismatch  between  ATC  and  pilot  expectations,  ATC  will  provide  aircraft  with explicit  indications  with  regard  to  what  is  expected  in  terms  of  speed  and  level  at  all  times  using  'CANCEL (LEVEL/SPEED)  RESTRICTIONS'  or  'COMPLY  WITH  (LEVEL/SPEED)  RESTRICTIONS'  RTF  phraseology.

## RKSS  AD  2.23  ADDITIONAL  INFORMATION

1. Bird  concentrations  in  the  vicinity  of  the  airport
- a.  Summer  and  Autumn

White  Heron  appears  from  July  to  October,  which  is  migrant.  They  build  nests  randomly  on  any  field  around the  airport.  Due  to  the  resting  and  feeding  activity,  the  flock  activity  in  the  aerodrome  occurs  from  sunrise  to sunset.  Careful  attention  is  needed  during  landing  approach  and  take-off.

- b.  Winter

Between  October  and  March  of  the  coming  year,  migrant  birds  (mainly  wild  geese  and  ducks)  build  nests  on Han  river  downstream  (24 km  north  from  RWY  14).  The  flock's  main  activity  apt  to  occur  around  the  Gul-po stream  close  to  the  RWY  14R  and  14L  area.  Some  part  of  the  flock  enter  into  the  aerodrome  for  resting  and feeding  about  an  hour  before  sunrise  till  sunset.  The  flock  size  of  one  route  is  approximately  1 000  individuals. Sometimes  the  flock  flies  across  the  middle  of  the  runways  for  their  group  movement  in  the  daytime.  The  flying height  varies  from  200 ft  to  1 000 ft.

- c.  Intense  activities  of  sedentary  birds  (pigeons  and  magpies)  and  seasonal  activity  of  various  migrants(wild  geese, ducks,  white  heron  and  etc..)  take  place  around  the  runways  and  the  airport  boundary  during  landing  and take-off  procedures.
- d.  Also,  Aerodrome  operator  estimates  the  bird  activities  and  hazard  to  inform  control  tower  of  the  possible hazard.  Then  the  tower  directly  warns  the  aircraft  pilots  of  the  hazard.  Dispersal  activities  for  the  birdstrike prevention  performed  by  the  aerodrome  control  team  include  random  playback  of  distress  noise  (AV-alarm  and Gas  canon),  elimination  of  the  wildlife  hazard  using  firearms  and  environmental  control  such  as  prohibiting  wide farming  activity.
